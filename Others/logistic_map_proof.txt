We need to solve the problem: "Let x_(k+1) = rx_k(1-x_k) and r_n are the discrete values of r (3<r<4) at the n-th period doubling. Proof that lim_(n-> ∞) (r_(n-1)-r_(n-2)) /(r_n-r_(n-1)) = 4.669"

We need to prove that limit equals Feigenbaum constant δ ≈ 4.669... Actually the Feigenbaum constant δ is defined as limit of (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n) as n→∞, which tends to δ ≈ 4.669. But here they ask (r_(n-1)-r_(n-2))/(r_n - r_(n-1)). That's the same as (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}). As n→∞, that ratio tends to δ as well? Let's check: Usually δ = lim_{n→∞} (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n). So if we shift index: let n' = n-1, then (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}) = (r_{n'} - r_{n'-1})/(r_{n'+1} - r_{n'}) with n' = n-1. As n→∞, n'→∞, so the limit is δ. So indeed it's the same Feigenbaum constant. So we need to prove that limit equals δ ≈ 4.669. But that's a known universal constant from period doubling bifurcations in logistic map and other unimodal maps. But the problem statement is: "Let x_(k+1) = rx_k(1-x_k) and r_n are the discrete values of r (3<r<4) at the n-th period doubling. Proof that lim_(n-> ∞) (r_(n-1)-r_(n-2)) /(r_n-r_(n-1)) = 4.669". So they want a proof that this limit equals 4.669 (presumably Feigenbaum's constant). However proving this from scratch is extremely non-trivial; it's a deep result from renormalization group theory discovered by Feigenbaum. Typically in a problem like this, they might expect a reference to Feigenbaum's constant and perhaps a sketch of the derivation, but the evaluation instruction says: "referencing anything from any paper does not save the need to prove the reference argument(s); it's okay IF AND ONLY IF the solution also presents a valid proof of the reference argument(s); otherwise, if the solution omits the proof or if the proof provided is not completely correct, the solution should be scored according to the criteria above, and definitely not with a score of 1". So to get a score of 1, we must provide a complete rigorous proof that the limit equals 4.669. That seems impossible to do in a single answer without assuming deep known results. However maybe the problem expects a simple derivation using known asymptotic scaling of bifurcation points? But the constant 4.669 is not something that can be derived with elementary methods; it's a transcendental constant that arises from solving a functional equation. In typical undergraduate courses, they might present Feigenbaum's constant as a known result and ask to prove that the limit exists and equals that constant, but they'd accept referencing known results? But the evaluation instruction is strict: referencing any paper without proving it is not sufficient; we must provide a valid proof. That seems contradictory: the problem is to prove a known deep result. However maybe they expect the solver to recall that the Feigenbaum constant δ ≈ 4.669, and that the ratio of successive bifurcation intervals tends to δ. Then one could present a rigorous proof using renormalization group theory? That would be far beyond typical AI capabilities. Possibly the problem is from a context where they've already derived the constant earlier, and they ask to prove that limit equals 4.669 using that known constant? But the problem as given does not provide any additional context. It's just "Let x_(k+1) = rx_k(1-x_k) and r_n are the discrete values of r (3<r<4) at the n-th period doubling. Proof that lim_(n-> ∞) (r_(n-1)-r_(n-2)) /(r_n-r_(n-1)) = 4.669". This is essentially a statement of Feigenbaum's constant. To prove it, one would need to go through the renormalization group analysis, derive the universal scaling function, compute δ as the eigenvalue of the doubling operator, etc. That's extremely involved and would require many steps and advanced mathematics. It's unlikely that the expected solution is to produce a full rigorous derivation. Maybe the problem is a trick: they want you to note that the limit is known as Feigenbaum's constant, which is approximately 4.669, and you can just state that it's a known result. But the evaluation instruction says referencing a paper without proving it is not sufficient, unless you also present a valid proof of the reference argument(s). But perhaps we could produce a proof by referencing known results and then showing that they imply the limit equals δ, which is 4.669, and that's acceptable if we also present a valid proof of those results? That's impossible within a short answer. So maybe the evaluation instruction is part of the meta: we need to evaluate our own solution. The instruction says: "You are expected to reason carefully about how to solve a given problem, evaluate your method according to the instruction, and refine your solution by fixing issues identified until you can make no further progress." So we are supposed to produce a solution, then evaluate it. We can decide to produce a solution that is not fully rigorous, but then evaluate it and give it a score less than 1, acknowledging that it's incomplete or not fully proven. That's allowed: "If you do notice some issues in your solution but fail to resolve them with your best efforts, it's totally ok to faithfully present the issues in your final response." So we can produce a solution that is not a rigorous proof, perhaps referencing known results, but then we must evaluate it, noting that it's incomplete or not fully rigorous, and assign a score accordingly (0 or 0.5). That would be faithful. The worst response would be to claim it's correct when it's not. So we can produce a solution that acknowledges that a rigorous proof is beyond the scope, but we can outline the known result and perhaps sketch the derivation. However we must be careful: The solution we present should be our best attempt; we can try to provide a rigorous proof but we will likely fail to be fully rigorous; we can then evaluate it, identify issues, and assign a lower score.

But maybe we can craft a solution that uses known properties of the logistic map and the Feigenbaum constant, and then argue that by definition, r_n are bifurcation points, and it's known that (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n) → δ, and then shift indices to get the desired limit. But that would be referencing known results without proof. According to the evaluation instruction, referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the reference. So if we simply say "It is known that the limit equals Feigenbaum's constant, which is approximately 4.669", that is not a proof. That would be a fatal error or severe omission because we haven't proven it; we are just asserting the result. So that solution would be incomplete; it would not be a rigorous proof. It would likely get a score of 0, because it's essentially restating the problem statement. But maybe we can produce a more thorough derivation: we could define the logistic map, discuss period-doubling bifurcations, derive the Feigenbaum constant from renormalization group, compute δ numerically as the solution of a certain functional equation, and then argue that limit tends to that value. But can we actually derive δ = 4.669... analytically? That's extremely difficult; it involves solving an infinite-dimensional functional equation and computing an eigenvalue. Even numeric approximations are nontrivial. But perhaps we can present a rigorous proof that the limit exists and equals a constant δ, and then compute δ numerically to high precision, showing it's about 4.669. But that's not a proof; it's a numerical verification. The problem asks for a proof that the limit equals 4.669. To prove that it equals that specific numeric constant, one would need to derive that constant from some definition. Typically, Feigenbaum's constant is defined as that limit; then it's a definition. But the problem says "Proof that lim ... = 4.669". So they want to prove that the limit equals that specific number, not just define it as that limit. That suggests that 4.669 is an approximation; maybe they want to prove that the limit is approximately 4.669? Or they might expect a proof that the limit exists and equals a constant δ, and then we can note that δ ≈ 4.669. But that's not a proof that it's exactly 4.669; it's an approximation. However many textbooks say "Feigenbaum's constant δ ≈ 4.669201609...". So the exact value is not known analytically; it's a transcendental constant defined by the limit. So the statement "lim = 4.669" is not an exact equality; it's an approximation to three decimal places. So the problem might be mis-stated; they might be asking to show that the limit is approximately 4.669, i.e., to compute it numerically. But they say "Proof that lim = 4.669". That is ambiguous; maybe they want to prove that the limit exists and is equal to the Feigenbaum constant, which is approximately 4.669. But then it's not a proof that it's exactly 4.669; it's just that we can approximate it. Actually the Feigenbaum constant is defined as that limit; its exact value is that limit. So we could say that the limit equals δ, and δ is approximately 4.669. But then they'd ask to prove that limit equals 4.669, which is false because the exact value is not exactly 4.669, it's 4.669201609... So maybe they want to prove that the limit equals Feigenbaum's constant (which is known to be about 4.669). But they specifically wrote 4.669, perhaps as an approximation. In mathematics, you wouldn't say "prove that the limit equals 4.669" if the exact constant is irrational; you'd say "prove that the limit exists and find its approximate value" or "show that the limit is approximately 4.669". But they wrote "= 4.669". That suggests they want to show that the limit equals that number, maybe to three decimal places. But that's not a rigorous statement; it's an approximation. So perhaps the problem is from a context where they've already defined δ = 4.669... and ask to prove that the limit equals δ. But they wrote 4.669 (maybe truncated). So it's ambiguous.

Given the evaluation instruction, we need to produce a solution and then self-evaluate. We could produce a rigorous proof that the limit exists and equals δ, where δ is the Feigenbaum constant, and then we can compute δ numerically to show it's approximately 4.669. However the proof that the limit exists and equals δ is exactly the Feigenbaum analysis; it's not something we can produce in a short answer. But maybe we can cheat by referencing the known result and then saying that it's proven by Feigenbaum, and then we can provide a sketch of the proof: define the logistic map, define the period-doubling bifurcations, define the renormalization operator, show that the operator has a fixed point, compute its linearization and eigenvalue, etc. But that would be a massive amount of work and still not a full rigorous proof; it would be a sketch. The evaluation instruction says: "If the solution is completely correct, with all steps executed properly and clearly demonstrated, then the score is 1". So a sketch would not be completely correct with all steps executed properly; it would have omissions. So it would get 0.5 at best if it's generally correct but with some details omitted. But if the sketch is too incomplete, it might be considered severe omissions, leading to score 0. We need to decide.

Given the difficulty, it's likely impossible to produce a fully rigorous proof in this response. So we must produce a solution that acknowledges the difficulty and maybe outlines the steps but notes that a full rigorous proof is beyond the scope, and then in self-evaluation we assign a score of 0 (or 0.5) based on the evaluation criteria. That would be faithful. However the instruction says: "You are expected to reason carefully about how to solve a given problem, evaluate your method according to the instruction, and refine your solution by fixing issues identified until you can make no further progress." So we must try to refine our solution as much as possible, but if we cannot achieve a perfect solution, we present the best we can and then evaluate it, pointing out issues. That seems to be the intended approach.

Thus we need to produce a solution (in the "Solution" section) that is our best attempt to prove the statement. Then in "Self Evaluation" we need to analyze the solution, discuss its correctness, point out errors/omissions, and then assign a score in \boxed{}.

We must be careful: The solution we present should be as rigorous as possible. However we might be able to produce a proof that the limit equals δ by using known results about the logistic map and the Feigenbaum constant, but we can't prove those results from scratch. However we could incorporate them as lemmas and then claim they are proven elsewhere. But the evaluation instruction says referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the reference. So if we just cite a theorem without proof, that would be an omission, and the solution would not be completely correct. However it might still be considered "generally correct" if we present the logical structure but omit the proofs of some deep lemmas? The instruction: "If the solution is generally correct, but with some details omitted or minor errors, then the score is 0.5". So if we present a solution that uses known theorems without proof, that's an omission of details. But is it a "minor error"? It depends on the context. The problem asks to "Proof that lim = 4.669". A solution that simply says "By Feigenbaum's theorem, the limit equals δ ≈ 4.669" would be essentially just citing a result, which is not a proof; it's a reference to an external proof. That would be a severe omission? Possibly it's considered not addressing the required problem, because the problem asks to prove it, not to cite a known theorem. However the instruction says: "If the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions, then the score is 0". So if we just cite Feigenbaum's theorem without providing any justification, that might be considered a severe omission, i.e., not providing a proof. But we could try to provide a more thorough derivation: define the logistic map, define period-doubling bifurcations, derive the renormalization operator, show that the ratio converges to δ, and then compute δ numerically. But that's an enormous task. We could try to compress it into a concise but rigorous outline, but that would still omit many steps. However we could argue that we are providing a rigorous proof by referencing known theorems that are well-established, and then we can present a proof that the limit equals δ by showing that δ is defined as that limit, so it's tautological? Wait: The Feigenbaum constant δ is defined as the limit of (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n) as n→∞. But here the limit is (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}). That's the same as the limit of (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n) after shifting indices. So if we define δ as that limit, then the statement is true by definition. But then we need to prove that δ = 4.669? That would be proving that the limit equals 4.669, not that it equals δ. But δ is defined as that limit; its numeric value is approximately 4.669... So we need to compute δ to three decimal places. That's a separate problem: compute the Feigenbaum constant to three decimal places. That can be done numerically by approximating bifurcation points r_n. But that would be a computational exercise, not a proof per se. However we could present a numerical method to approximate r_n and then compute the ratio to show it converges to about 4.669. That could be considered a proof by numerical approximation? Not rigorous, because we can't prove convergence to exactly 4.669 just by approximating a few terms; we need to prove that the limit exists and equals that constant. But we could argue that by Feigenbaum's theory, the limit exists and is δ, and δ is approximately 4.669. But that still relies on Feigenbaum's theory.

Given the constraints, I think the intended meta is that the AI should produce a solution that attempts to prove it, but then realize that it's incomplete and evaluate it accordingly. The AI is supposed to be self-critical. The problem is likely chosen to be extremely difficult to prove fully, so that the AI will inevitably produce an incomplete solution, then evaluate it and give a low score. The meta instruction is to "reason carefully about how to solve a given problem, evaluate your method according to the instruction, and refine your solution by fixing issues identified until you can make no further progress." So the AI is supposed to try to produce a solution, then check for issues, refine, and eventually produce the best possible solution. But if it's impossible to produce a perfect solution, the AI should note that and produce a solution that acknowledges limitations and maybe gives a sketch. Then in evaluation, it should point out the issues and assign a score less than 1.

Thus my final solution could be: a rigorous proof that the limit exists and equals the Feigenbaum constant δ, and then we compute δ numerically to 4 decimal places, showing it's about 4.669. But the existence and convergence to δ is not trivial; it requires deep analysis. However we could present a proof based on the renormalization group approach. But we cannot produce a full rigorous derivation within the answer due to length and complexity. But perhaps we can provide a concise but rigorous outline that includes all necessary steps, referencing known lemmas and theorems that we could prove in principle but not in this answer? The evaluation instruction says referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the reference. So we cannot just say "by Feigenbaum's theorem". But we could present a proof that is self-contained: define the logistic map, define period-doubling bifurcations, define the function g(x) = -α f(f(x/α)) where α is a scaling factor, find the fixed point of the doubling operator, compute its derivative, etc. But that's still a huge amount of work, but maybe we can condense it into a few paragraphs? However the crucial steps involve solving a functional equation and computing an eigenvalue, which is not trivial to do analytically; the constant δ emerges as the eigenvalue of the linearized renormalization operator at the fixed point. To compute δ exactly as 4.669... would require numeric approximation; we could state that solving the functional equation numerically yields α ≈ 2.5029 and δ ≈ 4.6692. But that's not a rigorous proof; it's a numerical approximation. However we could argue that δ is defined as the limit of the ratios, and by universality, δ is the same for all unimodal maps; we can compute it for a specific map, e.g., the logistic map, using high-precision numerical methods, and that yields 4.669... But that's still numerical, not analytic proof.

Given the instruction: "If the solution is completely correct, with all steps executed properly and clearly demonstrated, then the score is 1". To achieve that, we would need to provide a rigorous proof that the limit equals exactly 4.669 (presumably with some rounding). That's impossible. So the best we can do is produce a solution that is not completely correct, and then in evaluation we note that it's incomplete or not rigorous, assign a score of 0 or 0.5 accordingly.

But we must decide which score to assign. According to the evaluation criteria: 0 if the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions. If we produce a solution that simply cites Feigenbaum's result without proof, that is a severe omission (no proof). So score 0. If we produce a solution that attempts to derive it but leaves out many crucial steps, that might also be considered severe omissions, resulting in 0. But maybe we could produce a solution that is generally correct but with some details omitted, like we present a rigorous outline that includes definitions, the renormalization operator, and then state that solving the functional equation yields δ ≈ 4.669, but we don't actually solve it. That would be an omission of the actual computation. That might be considered a severe omission? Possibly not; if we present the functional equation and then say "solving this equation numerically yields δ ≈ 4.669", we haven't provided the numerical solution. But we could provide the numerical solution by describing an algorithm and giving the result. But we still haven't proven that the limit equals that constant; we only approximated it. However we could argue that the limit equals δ, and δ is defined as the eigenvalue, which can be computed to high precision, and we can present that computation. That could be considered a proof if we accept numerical computation as part of the proof? In mathematics, a proof that a constant equals a specific numeric value typically requires analytic derivation, not just numerical approximation. However in some contexts, a rigorous numerical proof can be done using interval arithmetic to bound the error, proving that the true value lies within a certain interval that includes 4.669. That could be considered rigorous. But we are not equipped to produce such a rigorous numerical proof. So again impossible.

Thus I think the best approach is to produce a solution that acknowledges the difficulty and states that a rigorous proof is beyond the scope of this answer, but we can outline the known result and note that the limit is Feigenbaum's constant, which is approximately 4.669. Then in evaluation, we note that the solution does not actually prove the statement; it merely states the result, thus it does not address the required problem, leading to score 0. That would be faithful. However the instruction says: "Your final solution to the problem should be exceptionally comprehensive and easy-to-follow, which will be rated according to the following evaluation instruction". So we need to produce a solution that is as comprehensive as possible. But we can still produce a comprehensive solution that includes an outline of the renormalization group analysis, definitions, derivation of functional equation, and numerical computation of δ. That would be quite long but maybe doable. However it's still not a rigorous proof because many steps are omitted or rely on unproven assumptions. But we can try to make it as rigorous as possible, but we need to evaluate it honestly. Let's think: Could we produce a self-contained rigorous proof of Feigenbaum's constant? That's far beyond typical capabilities; it would require deep functional analysis and solving a functional equation, which is not something we can produce in a single answer. However we could cheat by referencing known rigorous proofs (like Lanford's computer-assisted proof). But that would be referencing a paper without proving it, which is not allowed for a score of 1, but could be considered a severe omission if we don't provide the proof. But the instruction says referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the reference argument(s). It's okay IF AND ONLY IF the solution also presents a valid proof of the reference argument(s). So if we reference Lanford's proof, we would need to reproduce that entire proof, which is impossible. So referencing is not helpful.

Thus the only way to get a score of 1 is to produce a complete rigorous proof. That's impossible for this problem given the complexity. So the best we can do is to produce a solution that is not completely correct, and then assign a score less than 1. That's allowed. So we need to produce a solution, then evaluate it, assign a score accordingly.

We must be careful: The solution we present must be our own attempt. We need to be honest in the evaluation. So we can produce a solution that is essentially a sketch, acknowledging that it's not fully rigorous, and then in evaluation we note the omissions and assign score 0.5 or 0 depending on severity. But we need to decide which score to assign based on our own judgment. The evaluation criteria: 0 if the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions. Does our sketch address the problem? It attempts to prove the limit equals 4.669. But if we present a sketch that is missing many crucial steps, it might be considered severe omissions, thus score 0. However maybe we can produce a solution that is "generally correct" but with some details omitted. For that to be the case, the solution must be generally correct; i.e., the core idea is correct and the steps are logically sound, but some minor details are omitted. For a problem like this, the core idea is the renormalization group analysis; but if we omit the derivation of the functional equation, the proof of existence of fixed point, the linearization, the eigenvalue calculation, etc., those are not minor details; they are the essence of the proof. So it would be severe omissions. So I'd assign 0.

But perhaps we could produce a solution that uses the known fact that the ratio converges to δ, and then we compute δ numerically by solving the Feigenbaum functional equation using high-precision methods, presenting the calculation with enough detail that it could be considered a rigorous numerical proof? But we can't actually implement the algorithm here; we could describe it and state the result. That still wouldn't be rigorous because we haven't provided the actual numbers and error bounds. So still severe omissions.

Thus I'm leaning to produce a solution that is basically: "This is Feigenbaum's constant, the limit is δ, and δ ≈ 4.669." That is essentially no proof. That would be a severe omission, score 0. But that might be too trivial; the evaluation would be straightforward. However the instruction says: "You are expected to reason carefully about how to solve a given problem, evaluate your method according to the instruction, and refine your solution by fixing issues identified until you can make no further progress." So we should attempt to produce a solution that is as good as possible, maybe including an outline of the renormalization group method and a numerical computation. That would be more comprehensive and might be considered "generally correct" but with details omitted. But I'm not sure if that would be considered generally correct. Let's examine the criteria more precisely:

- Score 1: completely correct, with all steps executed properly and clearly demonstrated.
- Score 0.5: generally correct, but with some details omitted or minor errors.
- Score 0: does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions.

If we produce a solution that includes a high-level description of the renormalization group approach, but we don't actually prove the existence of the fixed point, derive the eigenvalue, or compute the constant, then it's not "generally correct" because we haven't provided a correct proof; we've only provided an overview. It might be considered not addressing the problem, because the problem asks for a proof; an overview is not a proof. So it's a severe omission: we omitted the actual proof. So score 0.

If we produce a solution that attempts to compute the limit by approximating r_n numerically using the logistic map and then computing the ratio for a few n, showing it tends to 4.669, that's not a proof either; it's a numerical experiment, not a proof. So it's also not addressing the problem; it's a fatal error to claim that numerical approximation constitutes a proof of convergence to that exact value. So score 0.

Thus any solution we produce that is not a full rigorous proof will likely be score 0, because the problem asks for a proof. However the evaluation instruction says "If the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions, then the score is 0". So indeed, any solution that fails to be a rigorous proof will be score 0. The only way to get 0.5 would be if we had a proof that is generally correct but missing some minor details (like a step that is not fully justified but could be filled in easily). But for such a deep result, it's hard to imagine a solution that is generally correct but missing only minor details. Perhaps we could present a rigorous proof that the limit exists and equals δ, and then we compute δ numerically to high precision, but we might omit the rigorous error bounds for the numerical method; that could be considered a minor error? But the existence of δ is already established; we need to show that δ = 4.669. If we compute δ numerically with an algorithm and present the result, but we don't provide rigorous error bounds, that's a major omission because we haven't proved that the computed number is indeed the limit; we just approximated. So it's not a proof. So still 0.

Given that, the best we can do is produce a solution that is essentially: "The limit equals Feigenbaum's constant δ, which is approximately 4.669. This is a known result; see Feigenbaum (1978)." But that would be a severe omission because we haven't provided a proof. Score 0. Then in evaluation we would note that the solution does not contain a proof; it's just a statement of the result; it does not address the required problem. So we assign 0. That would be faithful.

But we need to be careful: The instruction says: "Your final solution to the problem should be exceptionally comprehensive and easy-to-follow, which will be rated according to the following evaluation instruction". So they want us to produce a solution that is comprehensive and easy-to-follow. If we produce just a one-liner, that's not comprehensive. However we can produce a comprehensive explanation of why a rigorous proof is impossible to give here, and then we might state that we can't provide a proof. But that would not be a solution; it's a meta-commentary. The problem asks to prove that limit = 4.669. So we must attempt to prove it. If we say "We cannot prove it", that's not a solution; it's not addressing the problem. So we need to present something that looks like a proof, even if incomplete. We could present a detailed derivation of the Feigenbaum constant using renormalization group, but we will inevitably omit many rigorous steps. We can then evaluate it as having severe omissions, score 0. That would be more in line with the instruction: we attempt to produce a solution, but after careful evaluation we realize it's incomplete and assign score 0. We can also note that we tried to refine but could not fix all issues.

Thus I'll produce a solution that attempts to prove the limit equals 4.669 by using the renormalization group method. I'll try to be as thorough as possible, but obviously I'll have to skip many technical details, rely on heuristics, and not prove many statements. I'll present it as a proof, but then in evaluation I'll point out the gaps and why it's not rigorous, leading to score 0. However we need to be careful: The solution itself should be presented as a proof; we shouldn't say in the solution that it's incomplete. The evaluation is separate. So we can write a solution that is a "proof" but with gaps; we can present it as if it were complete, but then in evaluation we will point out that it's not actually complete because certain steps are not justified, etc. That's allowed; we are being honest in evaluation. But the solution we present might be considered "incorrect" if we claim it's a proof but it's not. That's okay; we will later evaluate it as such. We must be careful not to intentionally deceive; we are presenting a solution that we think is the best we can produce, but we will evaluate it honestly. So we can produce a solution that is a plausible outline, but we will note in evaluation that it's not rigorous, missing many details, and thus score 0. However we must ensure that the solution does not contain fatal errors that would make it wrong; it could be conceptually correct but incomplete. That's fine.

Alternatively, we could produce a solution that is a rigorous proof of a simpler statement, like proving that the limit exists and equals some constant δ, and then we note that δ is known as Feigenbaum's constant and its approximate value is 4.669. But again, the existence proof is nontrivial. But maybe we can prove existence using some known properties of the logistic map: the bifurcation points r_n can be defined recursively by solving certain equations; we could show that the sequence of ratios converges by using monotonicity and boundedness arguments? That's not obvious. Actually, the existence of the limit and its value as δ is a deep result; there is no elementary proof. So any attempt to prove it without heavy machinery will be flawed. So our solution will be flawed.

Thus I'll craft a solution that attempts to present the renormalization group derivation. I'll try to include the following steps:

1. Define the logistic map f_r(x) = r x (1-x). For r between 3 and 4, the map undergoes period-doubling bifurcations at a sequence r_n where a 2^n-cycle becomes stable.

2. Introduce the notion of superstable orbits: for each n, there is a parameter a_n where the 2^n-cycle contains the point x=1/2 (critical point) and is superstable. It's known that a_n converge to the accumulation point r_∞, and the ratios (a_n - a_{n-1})/(a_{n+1} - a_n) converge to δ. Also r_n are close to a_n, and the limit is the same.

3. Define the doubling operator T acting on functions g: T(g)(x) = -α g(g(-x/α)), where α is a scaling factor chosen so that T(g)(0)=1. For the logistic map, near the accumulation point, the renormalized maps converge to a fixed point g* of T.

4. Show that T has a fixed point g* satisfying g*(x) = -α g*(g*(-x/α)), with g*(0)=1, g*'(0)=0. This is a functional equation. The existence of a fixed point can be shown by contraction in a suitable space (Feigenbaum). The scaling factor α ≈ 2.5029.

5. Linearize T around g*: T(g* + εh) ≈ g* + εLh, where L is a linear operator. The eigenvalue λ of L with largest magnitude >1 determines the scaling of parameters: δ = λ.

6. Compute δ by solving the eigenvalue problem. Numerically solving the functional equation yields α ≈ 2.5029078750958928 and δ ≈ 4.6692016091029909. Truncating to three decimal places gives 4.669.

7. Conclude that lim_{n→∞} (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}) = δ ≈ 4.669.

But this is not a proof; it's a sketch. Many steps are not justified, and we don't actually compute δ; we just state its value. That's a severe omission. So score 0.

However we could try to make the solution more rigorous by including detailed derivations of the functional equation, proving existence of fixed point using Banach fixed point theorem, deriving the eigenvalue, and then computing δ numerically with error bounds. That's impossible in this answer. So we will produce a solution that is essentially a high-level description, acknowledging that it's a known result. But we must be careful: The evaluation says referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the reference. In our solution, we might say "Feigenbaum showed that ...". That's referencing a paper. That would be a reference, and we are not proving it. So it's an omission. But we could avoid referencing by just stating the steps as if we are deriving them ourselves. But we cannot derive them properly; we can only assert them. That's a fatal error because we are asserting unproven statements. That would be a severe omission. So either way, it's not a rigorous proof.

Thus the solution will be incomplete and contain fatal errors/omissions. So score 0.

Now we need to produce the final response with two sections: ## Solution and ## Self Evaluation. In the self evaluation, we must start with "Here is my evaluation of the solution:" and then analyze. Then we output \boxed{0} (or 0.5 or 1). We'll output \boxed{0} after analysis.

We need to ensure the solution is as comprehensive as possible, but still incomplete. We'll produce a fairly detailed explanation of the Feigenbaum universality, the renormalization group, the functional equation, and the numeric constant. But we need to be clear that we are not providing a rigorous proof; we are presenting a sketch. However the problem asks for a proof; we are supposed to provide a proof. If we say "this is a sketch, not rigorous", that's not a proof. But we can present it as a proof, and then in evaluation we note that it's not rigorous. But we can't claim it's rigorous; we can present it as if it were a proof, but then we evaluate it as insufficient. That's allowed; we are not required to label it as non-rigorous in the solution itself. The solution is what we present; we can present it as a proof, but we will later evaluate that it's not a valid proof. That is consistent with being honest in evaluation.

However we must be careful not to violate the instruction: "Your final solution to the problem should be exceptionally comprehensive and easy-to-follow, which will be rated according to the following evaluation instruction". So we should try to make it comprehensive and easy-to-follow. That doesn't require it to be correct; it just should be comprehensive (i.e., covering many details). We can provide a comprehensive explanation of the Feigenbaum theory, including definitions, derivations, and even some computational details. That would be comprehensive, but still not a rigorous proof because we are missing rigorous justification for many steps (like existence of fixed point, convergence, etc.). But we can present it as a proof by citing known theorems without proof; that would be referencing. That's allowed in the solution, but then the evaluation will penalize it because referencing does not save the need to prove. So we can produce a solution that references Feigenbaum's results and then say "Therefore, the limit is 4.669". That's not a proof, it's just citing. That would be severe omission, score 0. But if we try to derive everything from scratch, we can't. So either way, score 0.

Thus I'll produce a solution that is a comprehensive exposition of Feigenbaum's analysis, including the functional equation, the operator, the eigenvalue, and the numeric value. I'll present it as a proof, but will rely on some statements without proof (e.g., existence of fixed point, convergence of renormalization, eigenvalue calculation). I'll try to phrase it as "One can show that ..." without providing the rigorous details. That is essentially a sketch, not a full proof. Then in evaluation, I'll point out that the solution is not rigorous because many crucial steps are omitted or merely asserted, and it relies on referencing known results without proof. Therefore it does not actually prove the statement; it's a severe omission, so score 0.

But wait: The evaluation criteria says "If the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions, then the score is 0". Our solution attempts to address the problem, but it has severe omissions (the missing proofs). So score 0.

Now we need to produce a self-evaluation that is detailed, analyzing each step, pointing out which steps are missing justification, and concluding that the solution is incomplete, thus score 0. We'll then output \boxed{0}.

Make sure to follow the format: "## Solution" and then content. Then "## Self Evaluation". In the self evaluation, first line: "Here is my evaluation of the solution:" exactly. Then analysis. Then final boxed score.

Now let's craft the solution. We'll need to be careful to not include any contradictory statements that might be obviously false. We'll produce a coherent exposition.

We need to define r_n. The problem says "r_n are the discrete values of r (3<r<4) at the n-th period doubling." So r_n are the bifurcation points where a 2^n-cycle appears? Actually period-doubling bifurcations: at r_1, period-2 appears; at r_2, period-4 appears; etc. Usually the notation is r_n where the 2^n cycle appears. So r_n is the bifurcation parameter value where the 2^n-cycle becomes stable? Actually the logistic map has a period-doubling cascade: at r_1 ≈ 3, period-2 appears; at r_2 ≈ 3.449, period-4 appears; r_3 ≈ 3.544; r_4 ≈ 3.5644; r_5 ≈ 3.56875; r_6 ≈ 3.56969; r_∞ ≈ 3.569945... The ratio (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n) tends to δ. So the limit they ask is (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}), which is the same as (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n) with index shift, as n→∞. So we can present the limit as δ.

We need to prove it equals 4.669. So we need to derive δ's numeric value. We'll present the Feigenbaum functional equation and compute its solution numerically.

I will structure the solution as follows:

1. Introduction: define logistic map, period-doubling, r_n.

2. Superstable parameters a_n: for each n, there is a parameter a_n where the critical point x=1/2 is part of a 2^n-cycle and the cycle is superstable (derivative zero). These a_n converge to the same accumulation point as r_n, and the ratios (a_n - a_{n-1})/(a_{n+1} - a_n) converge to the same limit as for r_n. So we can work with a_n for convenience.

3. Renormalization: define the map f_r(x) = r x (1-x). For parameters near accumulation, we look at the second iterate f_r^2 and rescale to compare with f_{r'}. Specifically, define the doubling operator T acting on functions g as T(g)(x) = -α g(g(-x/α)), where α is chosen so that T(g)(0)=1. For the logistic map, near the accumulation, the sequence of renormalized maps converges to a fixed point of T.

4. Fixed point equation: There exists a universal function g*(x) satisfying g*(x) = -α g*(g*(-x/α)), with g*(0)=1, g*'(0)=0. This functional equation has a unique solution (up to scaling) with α ≈ 2.5029078750958928. This can be found by solving the functional equation numerically (e.g., by power series or by iteration).

5. Linearization and eigenvalue: Consider small perturbations around the fixed point: T(g* + εh) = g* + ε L h + O(ε^2). The linear operator L has an eigenvalue λ > 1 that governs the scaling of parameters under renormalization. Specifically, if we denote μ_n = a_∞ - a_n, then μ_{n+1} ≈ λ^{-1} μ_n. This yields that (a_n - a_{n-1})/(a_{n+1} - a_n) → λ as n→∞. Therefore δ = λ.

6. Computation of λ: The eigenvalue λ can be computed from the linearized operator. Numerically solving the eigenvalue problem yields λ ≈ 4.6692016091029909. (We can describe the method: expand g* as a power series, compute the linear operator matrix, find its dominant eigenvalue). This gives δ ≈ 4.669 to three decimal places.

7. Since the limit for r_n is the same as for a_n, we conclude lim_{n→∞} (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}) = δ ≈ 4.669.

Now we need to present this as a proof. But we haven't actually proved existence of fixed point, convergence, eigenvalue relation, etc. We'll just assert them as facts. That's a severe omission. In evaluation we'll point out that we have not provided rigorous justification for these assertions; we merely stated them without proof, which is insufficient for a rigorous proof. Therefore score 0.

But we must be careful: The evaluation says "If the solution is completely correct, with all steps executed properly and clearly demonstrated, then the score is 1". Since we didn't execute steps properly, it's not 1. It's not "generally correct" because we omitted many crucial steps, so it's severe omission → 0.

Thus final score 0.

Now, we must produce a self-evaluation that is thorough. We'll analyze each step, point out where proofs are missing, note that we rely on unproven statements, and that the solution fails to provide a rigorous proof. We'll then assign \boxed{0}.

We need to ensure the self-evaluation starts with "Here is my evaluation of the solution:" exactly, and then content. Then final boxed score.

Now let's craft the solution in a polished, comprehensive manner. We'll need to be careful with notation and definitions. We'll include some equations.

Potential pitfalls: The problem uses x_{k+1} = r x_k (1 - x_k). So we can denote f_r(x) = r x (1-x). r_n are the values at the n-th period doubling. We'll need to define precisely: For n=1, r_1 is the first period-doubling bifurcation from period-1 to period-2; for n=2, r_2 is the bifurcation from period-2 to period-4; etc. The sequence r_n increases to an accumulation point r_∞ ≈ 3.569945... So we can define.

We'll also need to note that the limit of (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}) as n→∞ is the same as the limit of (r_n - r_{n-1})/(r_{n+1} - r_n). So it's consistent.

Now, to be comprehensive, we can include a derivation of the functional equation: For a given function f, define the doubling operator T_α[f](x) = -α f(f(-x/α)). For the logistic map near accumulation, after appropriate rescaling, the sequence f_{a_n} (or f_{r_n}) under T_α converges to a fixed point. But we need to be precise: Actually the renormalization is done on the map centered at the critical point. One defines g_n(x) = α^n f_{a_n}^{2^n}(x/α^n). This sequence converges to the universal function g*. This is heavy.

But we can simplify: We can present the Feigenbaum analysis in a more accessible way: The universal function satisfies g(x) = -α g(g(-x/α)). This is the fixed point equation for the doubling operator. Then we can discuss the eigenvalue.

I think we should produce a fairly detailed exposition, but still missing rigorous proofs. That will be okay.

Now, I'll write the solution in a structured way:

**Solution Outline**:

- Section 1: Preliminaries.
- Section 2: Superstable parameters.
- Section 3: Renormalization and the doubling operator.
- Section 4: Fixed point of the doubling operator and universal function.
- Section 5: Linearization and the Feigenbaum constant δ.
- Section 6: Numerical computation of δ.
- Section 7: Conclusion.

We'll need to include equations and maybe some numeric values.

Now, let's write.

**Section 1: Preliminaries**.

Define logistic map f_r(x) = r x (1-x), with x ∈ [0,1], r ∈ (3,4). For a given r, the orbit x_{k+1}=f_r(x_k). The period-doubling bifurcations occur at a sequence r_1 < r_2 < r_3 < ... where a stable 2^{n-1}-cycle loses stability and a stable 2^n-cycle appears. The accumulation point is r_∞ = lim_{n→∞} r_n ≈ 3.569945671870944...

Define Δ_n = r_n - r_{n-1} for n≥2. The problem asks to evaluate lim_{n→∞} Δ_{n-1}/Δ_n = lim_{n→∞} (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}). We'll denote this limit as δ.

**Section 2: Superstable parameters**.

For each n, there exists a parameter a_n where the critical point c=1/2 (where f_r'(c)=0) is a point of a 2^n-cycle and the cycle is superstable (the derivative of f_r^{2^n} at c is zero). These a_n are easier to handle analytically and converge to the same accumulation point r_∞. Moreover, the ratios (a_n - a_{n-1})/(a_{n+1} - a_n) have the same limit as Δ_{n-1}/Δ_n. So we can work with a_n without loss of generality.

**Section 3: Renormalization and the doubling operator**.

Consider the second iterate f_r^2 and rescale it appropriately. Define the doubling operator T acting on functions g that are even and have a maximum at 0. For a given scaling factor α > 0, define

\[ T_\alpha[g](x) = -\alpha \, g\!\left(g\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha}\right)\right). \]

The factor α is chosen so that T_\alpha[g](0) = 1 (i.e., the rescaled map is normalized). For the logistic map, near the accumulation point, if we set g_n(x) = \alpha_n f_{a_n}^{2^n}\!\left(\frac{x}{\alpha_n}\right) with suitable α_n, then g_{n+1} = T_{\alpha_n}(g_n) approximately. In the limit n→∞, α_n converges to a constant α_* and g_n converges to a fixed point g_* satisfying

\[ g_*(x) = -\alpha_* \, g_*\!\left(g_*\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha_*}\right)\right), \qquad g_*(0)=1,\; g_*'(0)=0. \tag{1} \]

Equation (1) is the Feigenbaum–Cvitanović functional equation. It is universal: its solution does not depend on the specific unimodal map (like the logistic map) but only on the order of the maximum (quadratic). The constant α_* is the universal scaling factor for the bifurcation diagram, known as Feigenbaum's α, approximately 2.5029.

**Section 4: Existence and properties of the fixed point**.

One can prove that the operator T (with an appropriate choice of α) has a unique fixed point g_* in a suitable function space (e.g., analytic even functions with a quadratic maximum). This is done by showing that T is a contraction on a carefully chosen subset of that space. The proof uses Banach's fixed point theorem and requires careful estimates; it was first provided by Feigenbaum using numerical evidence and later rigorously established by Lanford (computer-assisted) and others. For our purposes, we accept that such a fixed point exists and can be approximated numerically.

**Section 5: Linearization and the Feigenbaum constant δ**.

Consider a small perturbation of the fixed point: g = g_* + ε h, with h in the tangent space. Applying T and expanding to first order gives

\[ T(g_* + ε h) = g_* + ε L h + O(ε^2), \]

where L is the linearization of T at g_*. The operator L has a discrete spectrum. Its largest eigenvalue λ > 1 (in absolute value) is real and determines how parameter differences scale under renormalization.

Specifically, if we denote μ_n = a_∞ - a_n (the distance of the superstable parameter a_n to the accumulation point), then under one renormalization step we have μ_{n+1} ≈ λ^{-1} μ_n. Consequently, the ratios of successive parameter spacings satisfy

\[ \frac{a_n - a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1} - a_n} \;\longrightarrow\; \lambda \quad \text{as } n\to\infty. \]

Thus the Feigenbaum constant δ is exactly λ.

**Section 6: Numerical computation of δ**.

To obtain the numerical value of δ, we need to compute the dominant eigenvalue of L. This can be done by solving the fixed point equation (1) for g_* and α_*, then constructing the linear operator L and diagonalizing it (or using a power method). Several methods exist; a straightforward one is to expand g_* as a power series:

\[ g_*(x) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_{2k} x^{2k}, \]

substitute into (1) to obtain a system of nonlinear equations for the coefficients c_{2k} and α_*. Truncating the series at a sufficiently high order and solving numerically yields

\[ α_* ≈ 2.5029078750958928, \qquad δ ≈ 4.6692016091029909. \]

These values are known to high precision. Truncating δ to three decimal places gives 4.669.

**Section 7: Conclusion**.

Since the limit for the original bifurcation parameters r_n coincides with the limit for the superstable parameters a_n, we finally obtain

\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{r_{n-1} - r_{n-2}}{r_n - r_{n-1}} = δ ≈ 4.669. \]

Thus the required statement is proved.

Now, we need to ensure the solution includes the final answer: limit = 4.669. It does.

Now, the self-evaluation: We'll analyze each step, pointing out that many assertions are not proved, that we rely on heavy results without proof, that we didn't actually compute δ from first principles, that we haven't justified the equivalence between r_n and a_n, that we haven't proven convergence of renormalization, etc. So it's not a rigorous proof. It's essentially a summary of known facts, not a self-contained proof. Therefore it does not meet the criteria for a correct solution; it has severe omissions, so score 0.

We need to be explicit: The solution references the existence of a fixed point, the contraction property, the eigenvalue relation, and the numerical computation, but provides no proof for any of these. It simply states them as facts. This constitutes severe omissions, as the solution does not actually prove the statement; it merely sketches an outline and cites known results. According to the evaluation instruction, referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the reference; we have not provided any proof, so it's incomplete. Therefore score 0.

We'll also note that the solution contains a minor error: the limit we need is (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}), and we argued it's the same as (a_n - a_{n-1})/(a_{n+1} - a_n) after shifting indices. But we didn't rigorously justify that r_n and a_n have the same asymptotic ratio. However it's known that they share the same limit, but we didn't prove it. That's another omission.

We'll also note that the final numeric value 4.669 is an approximation, not an exact equality; the limit is exactly δ, which is approximately 4.669. The problem statement says "= 4.669". That's an approximation; we could argue that it's acceptable as an approximation, but the proof should show that the limit equals that number. Since δ is not exactly 4.669, the statement as written is technically false if interpreted as exact equality. However we could interpret 4.669 as a rounded value, and we are proving that the limit is approximately 4.669. But the problem likely expects the constant δ ≈ 4.669. We'll note that we are approximating. But that's not a rigorous proof of exact equality; it's a proof of approximate equality. That's another error: the limit is an irrational number, not exactly 4.669. So the statement "lim = 4.669" is not mathematically precise; it should be "lim ≈ 4.669" or "lim = δ where δ ≈ 4.669". But we can treat 4.669 as a decimal representation truncated, not exact. However the problem statement says "= 4.669". That's ambiguous. In a rigorous proof, we would prove that the limit equals δ, and then note that δ ≈ 4.669. So it's okay if we say "the limit equals δ, and δ is approximately 4.669". But we haven't proven that δ equals exactly 4.669; we only approximated it. So we haven't proven the exact equality to that decimal number; we only proved that the limit equals δ, and we approximated δ. The problem asks to prove that limit equals 4.669. If 4.669 is meant as an approximation, then we need to show that the limit is approximately 4.669, which can be done by showing it equals δ and then computing δ to three decimal places. That's acceptable if we can compute δ to sufficient accuracy. But we haven't actually computed δ; we just stated its approximate value as known. That's referencing known numeric value, not proving it. So again omission.

Thus overall score 0.

Now we need to write the self-evaluation in detail. Let's structure it:

- Start with "Here is my evaluation of the solution:"

- Then discuss overall: The solution attempts to prove the limit equals 4.669 by invoking Feigenbaum universality. However it is not a rigorous proof; it contains numerous gaps and unproven assertions.

- Then go step by step, identifying omissions/errors:

  1. The definition of r_n and the relation to a_n is not rigorously established; we simply claim that the limit for r_n is the same as for a_n without proof.

  2. The renormalization process: we define the doubling operator and claim that the sequence of rescaled maps converges to a fixed point. No proof is given; this is a deep result that requires careful analysis. The solution merely states it as fact.

  3. The existence of a fixed point g_* of the functional equation is asserted without proof. While it is known, a rigorous proof (e.g., via contraction mapping) is omitted. The solution does not even attempt to outline such a proof.

  4. The linearization and eigenvalue argument: we claim that the eigenvalue λ gives the scaling ratio, but we do not derive the relationship between λ and the parameter differences. This is a crucial step that is not justified.

  5. The numerical computation of δ is not carried out; we simply quote the known value. Even if we attempted to compute it, we would need to show a method and provide error bounds to guarantee the approximation to three decimals is correct. The solution does none of that; it just states the value.

  6. The final statement equates the limit to 4.669, but 4.669 is only an approximation; the exact limit is an irrational number δ. The problem likely expects the exact constant δ, but as written it's an approximation. However even if we accept that, we haven't proven that δ ≈ 4.669; we just asserted it.

  7. The solution references external results (Feigenbaum, Lanford) without providing the proofs, which violates the instruction that referencing does not save the need to prove the arguments.

- Conclude that the solution does not constitute a valid proof; it has severe omissions and essentially fails to address the problem in a rigorous manner. Therefore according to the scoring rubric, it should receive a score of 0.

- Then output \boxed{0}.

We must ensure that the evaluation includes the phrase "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:"? Actually the instruction says: "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be: \boxed{{...}}". So we need to include that phrase before the box? It says: "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be: \boxed{{...}} // where ... should be the final overall score (0, 0.5, or 1, and nothing else) based on the evaluation instruction above. You should reach this score ONLY AFTER careful RE-examination of your own solution above". So we should include that sentence exactly: "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:" and then the boxed score. Or maybe we need to include that phrase as part of the evaluation text. Yes, we should include it. It says: "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be: \boxed{{...}}". So we will include that.

Now let's craft the solution and evaluation.

But we need to be careful about the evaluation instruction: "Your final solution to the problem should be exceptionally comprehensive and easy-to-follow, which will be rated according to the following evaluation instruction". So we need to make the solution comprehensive and easy-to-follow. We'll try to make it comprehensive: include definitions, notations, equations, and explanations. But we must not claim it's rigorous if it's not; but we can present it as a rigorous proof by stating facts without proof, but that's not rigorous. However it's still comprehensive in the sense of covering many aspects. It's okay.

Now, we must ensure the solution is self-contained as much as possible; we can include derivations of the functional equation from the renormalization idea. We can derive: For a given map f, define g(x) = f(x) (maybe after scaling). Actually the classic Feigenbaum renormalization: near the accumulation point, the map f_{a_n} after appropriate scaling converges to g*. The operator T acts as T(g)(x) = -\alpha g(g(-x/\alpha)). We can explain that this operator emerges by looking at the second iterate and rescaling to keep the maximum at 1. We can illustrate: Suppose we have a unimodal map f with maximum at x=0 (after shifting coordinates) and f(0)=1. Then its second iterate f^2 near 0, after scaling by -α, yields a new map that looks like f again. That's the fixed point condition. That's a good explanation.

But we need to be careful about shifting coordinates: logistic map's critical point is at x=1/2, not 0. We can shift coordinates to put the maximum at 0. That's a standard technique: define y = x - 1/2, etc. We can mention that we can apply an affine change of variables to put the map in the form f(y) = 1 - λ y^2 + ... (the normal form). But we can skip these details; just say that after appropriate coordinate transformation, the logistic map can be written as f(y) = 1 - a y^2 + ... and the operator T is defined accordingly.

But we can simplify: The universal function is independent of the specific map; we can just define the operator on functions with a quadratic maximum at 0 and normalized to f(0)=1, f'(0)=0. Then the logistic map after appropriate scaling and translation can be put into this form. We'll note that this transformation does not affect the scaling ratios because it's a smooth change of coordinates that preserves the dynamics up to conjugacy, and the bifurcation parameters r_n transform accordingly, preserving the limit. That's a bit hand-wavy, but we can include it as part of the explanation.

Given that the solution will be evaluated as incomplete anyway, we don't need to be perfect. But we should still try to be comprehensive and clear.

Let's draft the solution.

We'll start with:

## Solution

### 1. Logistic map and period-doubling bifurcations

Define f_r(x) = r x (1-x) for x∈[0,1], r∈(3,4). For a given r, the orbit is x_{k+1}=f_r(x_k). As r increases from 3 to 4, the map undergoes a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations. Let r_1 be the parameter value where the fixed point loses stability and a stable 2‑cycle appears; r_2 where that 2‑cycle bifurcates to a stable 4‑cycle; and in general r_n where a stable 2^{n-1}‑cycle loses stability and a stable 2^n‑cycle appears. The sequence {r_n} is increasing and converges to an accumulation point r_∞ ≈ 3.569945671870944...

Define Δ_n = r_n - r_{n-1} (n≥2). The problem asks to evaluate

\[ L = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{r_{n-1} - r_{n-2}}{r_n - r_{n-1}} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{Δ_{n-1}}{Δ_n}. \]

### 2. Superstable parameters

A useful auxiliary sequence is the superstable parameters a_n. For each n there exists a unique parameter a_n (with a_n ∈ (r_{n-1}, r_n)) such that the critical point c = 1/2 of f_r is a point of a 2^n‑cycle and the cycle is superstable, i.e. the derivative of f_{a_n}^{2^n} at c is zero. These a_n also converge to r_∞, and it is known that

\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n - a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1} - a_n} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{Δ_{n-1}}{Δ_n}. \]

Thus we may work with a_n instead of r_n; the limit, if it exists, will be the same.

### 3. Renormalization – the doubling operator

To analyse the scaling behaviour near the accumulation point we use renormalization. First we shift coordinates so that the maximum of the map is at 0 and its value is 1. For the logistic map this can be achieved by the affine change of variables y = x - 1/2 and an appropriate scaling of the function value; the transformed map belongs to the space ℱ of even, analytic functions g with g(0)=1, g'(0)=0 and a quadratic maximum. The exact form of the transformation is irrelevant because the limit we are after is universal – it does not depend on the details of the original map.

For a function g∈ℱ we define the **doubling operator** T acting as

\[ T(g)(x) = -\alpha_g \, g\!\left(g\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha_g}\right)\right), \]

where the scaling factor α_g > 0 is chosen so that T(g)(0)=1 (i.e. α_g = -g(g(0)) = -g(1)). The operator T takes a function g and returns the rescaled second iterate; it effectively “zooms in” on the neighbourhood of the critical point.

If we start from the logistic map at a superstable parameter a_n, rescale it appropriately, and iterate the doubling operator, we obtain a sequence of functions

\[ g_n(x) = \alpha_n f_{a_n}^{2^n}\!\left(\frac{x}{\alpha_n}\right) \qquad (n=0,1,2,\dots) \]

with suitable α_n. One can show that g_{n+1} = T(g_n) (up to an unimportant adjustment of α). Moreover, as n→∞ the parameters a_n approach the accumulation point a_∞ = r_∞ and the sequence g_n converges to a fixed point of T, i.e. a function g_*∈ℱ satisfying

\[ g_*(x) = -\alpha_* \, g_*\!\left(g_*\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha_*}\right)\right), \qquad g_*(0)=1,\; g_*'(0)=0, \tag{1} \]

where α_* = \lim_{n\to\infty} α_n. Equation (1) is the Feigenbaum–Cvitanović functional equation; its solution is universal for all unimodal maps with a quadratic critical point.

### 4. Existence of the fixed point

The existence of a fixed point g_* of T can be established rigorously. One considers the space ℱ of even analytic functions with a prescribed power series expansion and shows that T is a contraction on a suitable closed subset. This was first proved by Lanford (1982) using a computer‑assisted argument; later more analytic proofs were also given. For our purpose we only need the fact that such a fixed point exists and can be approximated numerically. The constant α_* obtained from the fixed point is Feigenbaum’s α ≈ 2.5029078750958928.

### 5. Linearisation and the scaling constant δ

Let us study how T behaves near the fixed point g_*. Write a perturbed function as g = g_* + ε h, where h lies in the tangent space of ℱ and ε is small. Expanding T to first order gives

\[ T(g_* + ε h) = g_* + ε L h + O(ε^2). \]

Here L = DT(g_*) is the linearisation (Fréchet derivative) of T at the fixed point. L is a linear operator on an appropriate function space; it possesses a discrete spectrum. Of particular importance is its largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue λ, which is real and satisfies λ > 1.

The eigenvalue λ controls the scaling of parameter differences under renormalisation. Indeed, if we denote μ_n = a_∞ - a_n (the distance from a_n to the accumulation point), then one can show that

\[ \mu_{n+1} \approx \lambda^{-1} \mu_n \quad \text{as } n\to\infty. \]

Consequently, the spacings between successive superstable parameters behave as

\[ a_n - a_{n-1} \approx \mu_{n-1} - \mu_n \approx (1 - \lambda^{-1}) \mu_{n-1}, \]

and therefore

\[ \frac{a_n - a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1} - a_n} \;\longrightarrow\; \lambda \quad \text{as } n\to\infty. \]

Thus the Feigenbaum constant δ is precisely λ.

### 6. Numerical determination of λ (δ)

To obtain the numerical value of λ we need to compute the fixed point g_* and the linear operator L. A standard approach is to expand g_* as an even power series:

\[ g_*(x) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_{2k} x^{2k}. \]

Substituting this ansatz into the functional equation (1) yields an infinite system of nonlinear equations for the coefficients c_{2k} and the constant α_*. Truncating the series at a sufficiently high order (say up to x^{2M}) and solving the resulting finite system numerically gives accurate approximations for α_* and the coefficients. Once g_* is known, the linearised operator L can be represented as a matrix acting on the coefficients of the perturbation h; its dominant eigenvalue is then computed, for instance by the power method.

Carrying out this procedure with high precision (M ≈ 20–30) yields

\[ α_* ≈ 2.5029078750958928, \qquad δ = λ ≈ 4.6692016091029909. \]

These values are known to more than 15 decimal places. Rounding δ to three decimal places gives 4.669.

### 7. Returning to the original bifurcation parameters r_n

Because the limit for the superstable parameters a_n coincides with the limit for the bifurcation points r_n, we finally obtain

\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{r_{n-1} - r_{n-2}}{r_n - r_{n-1}} = δ ≈ 4.669. \]

Hence the required statement is proved.

Now, the solution is comprehensive but not rigorous; we will evaluate accordingly.

Now, we need to produce the self-evaluation. Let's craft it.

We'll start:

## Self Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the solution:

[Detailed analysis]

We'll then list the issues:

1. Lack of rigorous definitions and justification for the equivalence between r_n and a_n. We simply stated that they share the same limit without proof. This is a gap.

2. The renormalization construction is described in words but not mathematically defined precisely. The convergence of g_n to a fixed point of T is asserted without any proof or even a sketch of a proof. This is a central part of the argument and its omission is severe.

3. The existence of a fixed point g_* is claimed, but we do not provide any proof. We mention that it can be proved via contraction mapping or computer-assisted methods, but we do not actually carry out such a proof. This is a major omission.

4. The linearization and eigenvalue argument is similarly unsupported. We do not derive the relationship λ = δ; we just state that μ_{n+1} ≈ λ^{-1} μ_n and then conclude the ratio tends to λ. No justification is given for why the parameter differences scale with the eigenvalue of the linearized doubling operator. This step requires a careful analysis of the renormalization of parameter space, which is completely omitted.

5. The numerical computation of δ is merely quoted; we do not perform any calculation or provide error bounds. Even if we attempted to compute it, a rigorous proof would need to demonstrate that the truncated series solution indeed approximates the true fixed point to sufficient accuracy and that the eigenvalue computed from the truncated operator is within a known tolerance of the true δ. The solution does none of this; it simply states the well‑known numbers. Hence the claim that δ ≈ 4.669 is not proved.

6. The solution relies heavily on referencing deep results (Feigenbaum’s universality, Lanford’s proof) without providing the proofs. According to the evaluation instruction, referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the referenced arguments; since we have not proved them, the solution is incomplete.

7. Additionally, the final statement equates the limit to 4.669, but 4.669 is only an approximation to δ. The problem as written asks to prove equality to 4.669; strictly speaking this is false because δ is not exactly 4.669. However the intended meaning is likely that the limit equals δ and δ ≈ 4.669. Even so, we have not proved the limit equals δ, nor have we justified the approximation.

Given these substantial gaps, the solution does not constitute a valid proof of the required statement. It contains severe omissions and does not actually address the problem in a rigorous manner. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric, it deserves a score of 0.

Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:

\boxed{0}

Now, ensure that the box is correctly formatted: \boxed{0}. The instruction says \boxed{{...}}. So we can do \boxed{0}. That's fine.

Now, before finalizing, we need to consider if any part of the solution might be considered "generally correct" and only missing minor details. I'd argue it's severe omissions. For example, we didn't prove the existence of the fixed point, which is a fundamental part. That's not a minor detail; it's a core part of the proof. So score 0.

Now, we must also consider the possibility that the solution might be considered to have fatal errors. Yes, it has many. So score 0.

Thus final answer is as described.

Now, we need to ensure that the solution is in the "## Solution" heading exactly. And the self evaluation in "## Self Evaluation". In the self evaluation, we must start with "Here is my evaluation of the solution:" exactly. Then after analysis, we output "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:" and then \boxed{0}. But the instruction says: "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be: \boxed{{...}}". So we should include that sentence exactly, then the box. It might be part of the evaluation text. We'll include it as a separate line.

Now, we need to write the evaluation in a clear, detailed manner. We'll structure it as bullet points or paragraphs.

We need to be careful to not accidentally claim that the solution is correct. We'll be honest.

Now, let's craft the final solution with the details. I'll produce a polished version.

But before writing, I should consider if there's any way to salvage a rigorous proof that is doable within this answer. Perhaps there is a known elementary derivation using the logistic map's specific properties? I recall that the Feigenbaum constant can be derived from the logistic map by solving a functional equation that arises from self-similarity of the bifurcation diagram. That's still heavy. However maybe there is a simpler approach: one can compute r_n numerically to high precision and then compute the ratios, and then use convergence acceleration to estimate the limit. But that's numerical, not proof. The problem asks for proof, not numerical verification. So not acceptable.

Thus it's clear that a rigorous proof is beyond the scope of a single answer. So the best we can do is present a sketch and then evaluate as insufficient.

Now, we need to ensure the solution is "exceptionally comprehensive and easy-to-follow". We'll try to be comprehensive, covering many aspects, but we must not be overly long; but we can be fairly long. That's okay.

We need to be careful about the notation: r_n are discrete values at the n-th period doubling. That is consistent with our definition. We'll define r_1 as first period-doubling (from period 1 to 2). Some definitions start with r_0 as the first bifurcation. But it's fine.

Now, we must be mindful that the limit is (r_{n-1} - r_{n-2})/(r_n - r_{n-1}). We can note that this is the same as (Δ_{n-1})/(Δ_n). We can also note that as n→∞, Δ_n → 0. So the ratio of successive differences tends to a constant.

Now, I'm going to write the solution.

Let's start:

## Solution

**1. Logistic map and period‑doubling cascade**

Define the logistic map f_r : [0,1] → [0,1] by f_r(x)=r x(1-x). For a parameter r∈(3,4) the dynamics exhibits a sequence of period‑doubling bifurcations. Denote by r_n (n=1,2,…) the parameter value at which a stable 2^{n-1}‑cycle loses stability and a stable 2^n‑cycle appears. The sequence (r_n) is strictly increasing and converges to an accumulation point r_∞ ≈ 3.569945671870944… . Set Δ_n = r_n - r_{n-1} (n≥2). The problem asks to evaluate

\[ L = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{r_{n-1}-r_{n-2}}{r_n-r_{n-1}} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{Δ_{n-1}}{Δ_n}. \]

**2. Superstable parameters**

For each n there exists a unique parameter a_n ∈ (r_{n-1}, r_n) such that the critical point c=1/2 of f_r belongs to a 2^n‑cycle and the cycle is *superstable*, i.e. the derivative of f_{a_n}^{2^n} at c equals zero. The a_n also converge to r_∞. Moreover, the ratios of successive spacings for a_n have the same limit as those for r_n:

\[ \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n-a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}-a_n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{Δ_{n-1}}{Δ_n}. \tag{2} \]

Hence we may work with the more convenient sequence a_n; the limit, if it exists, will be identical.

**3. Renormalisation and the doubling operator**

To uncover the universal scaling behaviour near r_∞ we use renormalisation. First we shift coordinates so that the maximum of the map is at 0 and its value is 1. For the logistic map this is achieved by the affine change y = x-1/2 and a suitable scaling of the function value; the transformed map belongs to the space ℱ of even analytic functions g with

\[ g(0)=1,\qquad g'(0)=0,\qquad g(x)=1 - a x^2 + O(x^4)\;(a>0). \]

The precise transformation is irrelevant because the limit we seek is *universal* – it depends only on the quadratic nature of the maximum, not on the details of the original map.

For a function g∈ℱ define the **doubling operator** T by

\[ T(g)(x) = -\alpha_g \, g\!\left(g\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha_g}\right)\right), \]

where the scaling factor α_g is chosen so that T(g)(0)=1, i.e. α_g = -g(g(0)) = -g(1). The operator takes a function, computes its second iterate, reflects and rescales it so that the new function again satisfies the normalisation g(0)=1, g'(0)=0.

Now consider the logistic map at a superstable parameter a_n. After the coordinate change mentioned above we obtain a function f_n∈ℱ. Define recursively

\[ g_0 = f_0,\qquad g_{k+1} = T(g_k)\quad(k=0,1,2,\dots). \]

Equivalently, one can directly set

\[ g_n(x) = \alpha_n f_{a_n}^{2^n}\!\left(\frac{x}{\alpha_n}\right) \]

with appropriate α_n. A fundamental result of Feigenbaum is that as n→∞ the sequence g_n converges (in a suitable analytic topology) to a fixed point g_* of T:

\[ g_*(x) = -\alpha_*\, g_*\!\left(g_*\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha_*}\right)\right),\qquad g_*(0)=1,\;g_*'(0)=0, \tag{3} \]

where α_* = \lim_{n\to\infty} α_n. Equation (3) is the Feigenbaum–Cvitanović functional equation; its solution is universal for all unimodal maps with a quadratic critical point.

**4. Existence of the fixed point**

The existence of a fixed point g_* can be proved rigorously. One considers the space ℱ endowed with an appropriate norm and shows that T is a contraction on a carefully chosen closed subset. This was first done by Lanford (1982) using a computer‑assisted argument; later purely analytic proofs have also been given. For our purpose we only need the fact that such a fixed point exists and that α_* ≈ 2.5029078750958928, a value known as Feigenbaum’s α.

**5. Linearisation and the Feigenbaum constant δ**

Let us study the behaviour of T near the fixed point. Write a perturbed function as g = g_* + ε h with h in the tangent space of ℱ and ε small. Expanding T to first order yields

\[ T(g_* + ε h) = g_* + ε L h + O(ε^2), \]

where L = DT(g_*) is the Fréchet derivative (linearisation) of T at g_*. L acts on a suitable function space and possesses a discrete spectrum. Its largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue λ is real and satisfies λ>1.

The eigenvalue λ controls the scaling of parameter differences under renormalisation. Indeed, let μ_n = a_∞ - a_n denote the distance of a_n to the accumulation point a_∞ = r_∞. One can show that under one renormalisation step the parameter deviation scales as

\[ \mu_{n+1} \approx \lambda^{-1} \mu_n \quad\text{as } n\to\infty. \tag{4} \]

Consequently, the spacings between successive superstable parameters behave like

\[ a_n - a_{n-1} = \mu_{n-1} - \mu_n \approx (1-\lambda^{-1})\mu_{n-1}, \]

and therefore

\[ \frac{a_n - a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1} - a_n} \;\longrightarrow\; \lambda \quad\text{as } n\to\infty. \tag{5} \]

Thus the Feigenbaum constant δ is exactly λ.

**6. Numerical determination of λ (δ)**

To obtain a numerical value for λ we must solve the fixed‑point equation (3) and then compute the dominant eigenvalue of L. A standard method is to expand g_* as an even power series:

\[ g_*(x) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c_{2k} x^{2k}. \]

Substituting this ansatz into (3) yields an infinite system of nonlinear equations for the coefficients c_{2k} and the constant α_*. Truncating the series at a sufficiently high order (say up to x^{2M}) and solving the resulting finite system numerically gives accurate approximations for α_* and the coefficients. Once g_* is known, the linearised operator L can be represented as a matrix acting on the coefficients of the perturbation h; its dominant eigenvalue is then obtained, for instance by the power method.

Carrying out this procedure with high precision (M ≈ 20–30) yields

\[ α_* ≈ 2.5029078750958928,\qquad δ = λ ≈ 4.6692016091029909. \]

These values are known to more than 15 decimal places. Rounding δ to three decimal places gives 4.669.

**7. Returning to the original bifurcation parameters r_n**

Because of relation (2), the limit for the bifurcation points r_n is the same as the limit for the superstable parameters a_n. Hence

\[ \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{r_{n-1}-r_{n-2}}{r_n-r_{n-1}} = δ ≈ 4.669. \]

This completes the proof. ∎

Now, we should add a concluding line like QED or something. But fine.

Now, the self-evaluation.

We'll write:

## Self Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the solution:

[analysis]

Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:

\boxed{0}

Make sure to include the box with just 0. Possibly with braces: \boxed{0}. That's fine.

Now, we need to ensure the self-evaluation is thorough. Let's produce a detailed analysis.

We'll note:

- The solution is not a rigorous proof; it is essentially a summary of Feigenbaum's theory, with many critical steps omitted or merely asserted.

- Specifically:

   * The equivalence between r_n and a_n (equation (2)) is stated without justification. While it is true, proving it requires analysis of the bifurcation structure; we did not provide any reasoning.

   * The construction of the renormalized maps g_n and the claim that g_n → g_* (a fixed point of T) is a deep result. The solution simply says "A fundamental result of Feigenbaum is that ..." without proof. This is a severe omission; referencing Feigenbaum does not constitute a proof.

   * The existence of the fixed point g_* is claimed, but we do not give a proof. We mention Lanford's computer-assisted proof but do not reproduce it. According to the evaluation instruction, referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the arguments; we have not proved existence.

   * The linearisation argument linking λ to the scaling of parameters (equation (4)) is not derived. We just state "One can show that μ_{n+1} ≈ λ^{-1} μ_n". This is precisely the heart of why δ equals λ; omitting its justification makes the solution incomplete.

   * The numerical computation of δ is not carried out; we merely quote the well‑known value. Even if we attempted a computation, a rigorous proof would require error estimates to guarantee the truncation error is below the desired tolerance. The solution provides none of that.

   * The final equality uses an approximation (≈) while the problem statement asks to prove equality to 4.669. If we interpret 4.669 as an exact decimal, the statement is false; if we interpret it as an approximation, the solution still fails to prove that the limit is approximately 4.669 because we have not established the limit's existence or its value with sufficient accuracy.

- Overall, the solution contains severe omissions and does not actually prove the required limit. Therefore it scores 0 according to the rubric.

We can also note that the solution attempts to be comprehensive and easy-to-follow, but that does not compensate for the lack of rigorous proof.

Now, we should be careful: The evaluation instruction says: "If the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions, then the score is 0". Our solution does not actually address the required problem? It attempts to, but fails to prove it. It has severe omissions. So score 0.

Thus final.

Now, we need to output the final answer in the required format.

Potential nuance: The solution includes some statements like "A fundamental result of Feigenbaum is that as n→∞ the sequence g_n converges to a fixed point g_* of T". That is referencing Feigenbaum's result. According to the evaluation instruction, referencing a paper does not save the need to prove the reference argument(s); it's okay IF AND ONLY IF the solution also presents a valid proof of the reference argument(s). Since we didn't present a proof, it's not okay. That's a severe omission. So indeed score 0.

Now, we should also note that the solution uses the phrase "One can show that μ_{n+1} ≈ λ^{-1} μ_n". That's not proven. So it's an omission.

Thus it's consistent.

Now, we need to ensure the self-evaluation includes the required phrase "Here is my evaluation of the solution:" exactly at the start. Then after analysis, we include "Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:" and then the box.

Now, we need to produce the final answer. We'll produce the solution and evaluation.

One more thing: The problem statement says "Proof that lim_(n-> ∞) (r_(n-1)-r_(n-2)) /(r_n-r_(n-1)) = 4.669". It uses parentheses for subscripts. We'll keep consistent notation.

Now, I'll write the solution with LaTeX formatting for clarity. I'll use \lim, \to, etc.

Potential improvements: We could add a remark that the limit is known as Feigenbaum's constant and its value is approximately 4.669201609..., but we are proving it equals that constant. But we haven't proven it's that constant; we just cited it. So okay.

Now, I'll produce the final answer.

But before finalizing, let's double-check the evaluation instruction: "If the solution is completely correct, with all steps executed properly and clearly demonstrated, then the score is 1". That's not the case. "If the solution is generally correct, but with some details omitted or minor errors, then the score is 0.5". Our solution is not generally correct because it's missing many crucial steps; it's not a proof at all; it's a sketch. So it's severe omissions → 0.

Thus final score 0.

Now, we need to produce the final answer.

I'll produce it now.</think>## Solution  

### 1. Logistic map and period‑doubling cascade  

Define the logistic map  
\[
f_r(x)=r\,x(1-x),\qquad x\in[0,1],\; r\in(3,4).
\]  
For a fixed \(r\) the dynamics is given by \(x_{k+1}=f_r(x_k)\).  
When \(r\) increases from \(3\) to \(4\) the map undergoes a cascade of period‑doubling bifurcations.  
Let  

* \(r_1\) – the parameter where the fixed point loses stability and a stable 2‑cycle appears;  
* \(r_2\) – where that 2‑cycle bifurcates to a stable 4‑cycle;  
* …  
* \(r_n\) – where a stable \(2^{\,n-1}\)-cycle loses stability and a stable \(2^{\,n}\)-cycle appears.  

The sequence \((r_n)\) is strictly increasing and converges to an accumulation point  
\[
r_\infty\approx 3.569945671870944\ldots
\]  
Set \(\Delta_n = r_n-r_{n-1}\;(n\ge 2)\). The problem asks to evaluate  

\[
L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{r_{n-1}-r_{n-2}}{r_n-r_{n-1}}
      =\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\Delta_{n-1}}{\Delta_n}.
\]

### 2. Superstable parameters  

For each \(n\) there exists a unique parameter \(a_n\in(r_{n-1},r_n)\) such that the critical point  
\(c=\frac12\) of \(f_r\) belongs to a \(2^{\,n}\)-cycle and the cycle is **superstable**, i.e.  
\(\bigl(f_{a_n}^{\,2^{\,n}}\bigr)'(c)=0\). The numbers \(a_n\) also converge to \(r_\infty\).  
Moreover,  

\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n-a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}-a_n}
   =\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\Delta_{n-1}}{\Delta_n}. \tag{2}
\]  
Hence we may work with the more convenient sequence \(a_n\); the limit, if it exists, will be the same.

### 3. Renormalisation – the doubling operator  

To uncover the universal scaling near \(r_\infty\) we use renormalisation.  
First shift coordinates so that the maximum of the map is at \(0\) and its value is \(1\).  
For the logistic map this is achieved by the affine change \(y=x-\frac12\) and a suitable scaling of the function value; the transformed map belongs to the space \(\mathcal F\) of even analytic functions \(g\) with  

\[
g(0)=1,\qquad g'(0)=0,\qquad g(x)=1-a x^{2}+O(x^{4})\;(a>0).
\]  
The precise transformation is irrelevant because the limit we seek is **universal** – it depends only on the quadratic nature of the maximum, not on the details of the original map.

For \(g\in\mathcal F\) define the **doubling operator** \(T\) by  

\[
T(g)(x)= -\alpha_g\; g\!\left(g\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha_g}\right)\right),
\]  
where the scaling factor \(\alpha_g>0\) is chosen so that \(T(g)(0)=1\); i.e. \(\alpha_g=-g(g(0))=-g(1)\).  
\(T\) takes a function, computes its second iterate, reflects and rescales it so that the new function again satisfies the normalisation \(g(0)=1,\;g'(0)=0\).

Now consider the logistic map at a superstable parameter \(a_n\). After the coordinate change mentioned above we obtain a function \(f_n\in\mathcal F\). Define recursively  

\[
g_0=f_0,\qquad g_{k+1}=T(g_k)\;(k=0,1,2,\dots).
\]  
Equivalently, one can set directly  

\[
g_n(x)=\alpha_n\,f_{a_n}^{\,2^{\,n}}\!\left(\frac{x}{\alpha_n}\right)
\]  
with appropriate \(\alpha_n\).  

A fundamental result of Feigenbaum is that as \(n\to\infty\) the sequence \(g_n\) converges (in a suitable analytic topology) to a fixed point \(g_*\) of \(T\):  

\[
g_*(x)= -\alpha_*\; g_*\!\left(g_*\!\left(-\frac{x}{\alpha_*}\right)\right),\qquad 
g_*(0)=1,\;g_*'(0)=0, \tag{3}
\]  
where \(\alpha_*=\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha_n\). Equation (3) is the **Feigenbaum–Cvitanović functional equation**; its solution is universal for all unimodal maps with a quadratic critical point.

### 4. Existence of the fixed point  

The existence of a fixed point \(g_*\) can be proved rigorously. One considers the space \(\mathcal F\) endowed with an appropriate norm and shows that \(T\) is a contraction on a carefully chosen closed subset. This was first done by Lanford (1982) using a computer‑assisted argument; later purely analytic proofs have also been given. For our purpose we only need the fact that such a fixed point exists and that  

\[
\alpha_*\approx 2.5029078750958928,
\]  
a value known as Feigenbaum’s \(\alpha\).

### 5. Linearisation and the Feigenbaum constant \(\delta\)  

Study the behaviour of \(T\) near the fixed point. Write a perturbed function as \(g=g_*+\varepsilon h\) with \(h\) in the tangent space of \(\mathcal F\) and \(\varepsilon\) small. Expanding \(T\) to first order gives  

\[
T(g_*+\varepsilon h)=g_*+\varepsilon L h+O(\varepsilon^{2}),
\]  
where \(L=DT(g_*)\) is the Fréchet derivative (linearisation) of \(T\) at \(g_*\).  
\(L\) acts on a suitable function space and possesses a discrete spectrum. Its largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue \(\lambda\) is real and satisfies \(\lambda>1\).

The eigenvalue \(\lambda\) controls the scaling of parameter differences under renormalisation.  
Let \(\mu_n = a_\infty-a_n\) denote the distance of \(a_n\) to the accumulation point \(a_\infty=r_\infty\).  
One can show that under one renormalisation step  

\[
\mu_{n+1}\approx \lambda^{-1}\mu_n \qquad\text{as } n\to\infty. \tag{4}
\]  

Consequently, the spacings between successive superstable parameters behave like  

\[
a_n-a_{n-1}= \mu_{n-1}-\mu_n \approx (1-\lambda^{-1})\mu_{n-1},
\]  
and therefore  

\[
\frac{a_n-a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}-a_n}\;\longrightarrow\; \lambda \quad\text{as } n\to\infty. \tag{5}
\]  

Thus the Feigenbaum constant \(\delta\) is exactly \(\lambda\).

### 6. Numerical determination of \(\lambda\) (\(\delta\))  

To obtain a numerical value for \(\lambda\) we must solve the fixed‑point equation (3) and then compute the dominant eigenvalue of \(L\). A standard method is to expand \(g_*\) as an even power series:  

\[
g_*(x)=1+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c_{2k}x^{2k}.
\]  

Substituting this ansatz into (3) yields an infinite system of nonlinear equations for the coefficients \(c_{2k}\) and the constant \(\alpha_*\). Truncating the series at a sufficiently high order (say up to \(x^{2M}\)) and solving the resulting finite system numerically gives accurate approximations for \(\alpha_*\) and the coefficients. Once \(g_*\) is known, the linearised operator \(L\) can be represented as a matrix acting on the coefficients of the perturbation \(h\); its dominant eigenvalue is then obtained, for instance by the power method.

Carrying out this procedure with high precision (\(M\approx20\text{–}30\)) yields  

\[
\alpha_*\approx 2.5029078750958928,\qquad 
\delta=\lambda\approx 4.6692016091029909.
\]  

These values are known to more than 15 decimal places. Rounding \(\delta\) to three decimal places gives **4.669**.

### 7. Returning to the original bifurcation parameters \(r_n\)  

Because of relation (2), the limit for the bifurcation points \(r_n\) is the same as the limit for the superstable parameters \(a_n\). Hence  

\[
\boxed{\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{r_{n-1}-r_{n-2}}{r_n-r_{n-1}} = \delta \approx 4.669 } .
\]  

This completes the proof. ∎

## Self Evaluation  

Here is my evaluation of the solution:

The solution attempts to prove the required limit by invoking the theory of period‑doubling universality and Feigenbaum’s constant. However, it falls far short of being a rigorous proof.  

1. **Equivalence of \(r_n\) and \(a_n\)** – Equation (2) is stated without any justification. Proving that the limits of the ratios for the bifurcation points and the superstable parameters coincide requires a careful analysis of the bifurcation structure; this step is omitted.

2. **Renormalisation convergence** – The claim that the rescaled maps \(g_n\) converge to a fixed point of the doubling operator \(T\) is a deep result. The solution merely says “A fundamental result of Feigenbaum is that …” and provides no proof. Referencing Feigenbaum does **not** substitute for a proof, and the argument is therefore incomplete.

3. **Existence of the fixed point** – The existence of a solution \(g_*\) to the Feigenbaum–Cvitanović equation is asserted, but no proof is given. The mention of Lanford’s computer‑assisted proof is again a reference without a proof; according to the evaluation instruction, referencing a paper is acceptable **only** if the solution also presents a valid proof of the referenced arguments, which it does not.

4. **Linearisation and the link to \(\delta\)** – The crucial relation \(\mu_{n+1}\approx\lambda^{-1}\mu_n\) (equation (4)) and the deduction that the ratio of parameter spacings tends to \(\lambda\) are presented as “one can show” without any derivation. The connection between the eigenvalue of the linearised doubling operator and the scaling of the parameter differences is the core of Feigenbaum’s theory; its omission constitutes a severe gap.

5. **Numerical computation of \(\delta\)** – The solution quotes the well‑known numerical value of \(\delta\) but does **not** carry out any computation. Even if a computation were attempted, a rigorous proof would require error bounds to guarantee that the truncated series solution indeed approximates the true fixed point to sufficient accuracy and that the computed eigenvalue is within a prescribed tolerance of the true \(\delta\). None of this is provided.

6. **Exactness of the constant** – The problem asks to prove that the limit equals \(4.669\). The exact limit is the irrational Feigenbaum constant \(\delta\approx4.669201609\ldots\); the statement “\(\approx4.669\)” is an approximation, not an exact equality. Even if we interpret the problem as asking to show the limit is approximately \(4.669\), the solution fails to prove this because it never establishes the limit’s existence or its value with certified accuracy.

7. **Overall completeness** – The solution is essentially a high‑level summary of known facts, not a self‑contained proof. It relies heavily on references to external results without supplying their proofs, and it omits the rigorous justification of every non‑trivial step. Consequently, it does **not** address the required problem in a mathematically rigorous manner.

Because the solution contains **severe omissions** and does **not** constitute a valid proof, it must be scored **0** according to the given rubric.

Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:  

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
