We need to find new approaches to proving that the zeta function at 5 is irrational. The problem states: "find new approaches to proving that the zeta function at 5 is irrational (the 1979 Apery approach that proved Zeta 3 irrational can't work)". So we are asked to propose new approaches, perhaps based on modern techniques, to attack the irrationality of ζ(5). This is an open problem: it is not known whether ζ(5) is irrational or not. ζ(3) is known to be irrational (Apéry 1979). ζ(2) is rational multiple of π^2, so irrational (transcendental? Actually π^2 is transcendental, so ζ(2) is transcendental). ζ(4) etc are rational multiples of π^4, so irrational. ζ(odd) > 3: unknown. Only ζ(3) is known to be irrational, and some results for ζ(odd) for many odd values (like at least one of ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11) is irrational? Actually there are results: Zudilin (2001) showed that at least one of ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11) is irrational. And there are results about linear independence: there are infinitely many irrational odd zeta values? Not known. So ζ(5) individually is unknown. So the problem is to "find new approaches" i.e., propose potential strategies, perhaps using modular forms, L-functions, hypergeometric series, etc. Possibly we can think about using methods similar to Apéry but adapted to ζ(5). Apéry's proof used a sequence of rational approximations to ζ(3) derived from certain hypergeometric sums and recurrences, leading to a fast convergence and small denominators, showing irrationality. For ζ(2) there is similar approach using Legendre polynomials. For ζ(5), attempts have been made but no success. So we need to think of new approaches that might circumvent the difficulties.

The problem might be from a contest or a research brainstorming. It says "find new approaches to proving that the zeta function at 5 is irrational (the 1979 Aperey approach that proved Zeta 3 irrational can't work)". So we need to propose some possible methods. The phrase "can't work" indicates that the Apéry approach cannot be directly extended to ζ(5) because the required approximations don't exist or something. So we need to think of other ideas.

We can discuss:

- Use of modular forms and values of L-functions at integer points.
- Connection to periods and motives, and use of the theory of multiple zeta values (MZV). Perhaps show that ζ(5) is a linear combination of some logarithms of algebraic numbers, or use of transcendence theory (e.g., Baker's theorem, Nesterenko's results). But ζ(5) is not known to be transcendental; irrationality is weaker. Could use techniques like Rhin-Viola for ζ(2) and ζ(3) but for ζ(5) might be more complicated.
- Use of irrationality measures: Apéry's proof gave an irrationality measure for ζ(3). Maybe we can try to find sequences giving good approximations to ζ(5) with small denominators. Possibly using hypergeometric integrals or Beukers-type integrals. Beukers gave an integral representation for ζ(2) and ζ(3) that leads to irrationality proofs. For ζ(2): ∫∫ (x(1-x)y(1-y))/(1-xy) dx dy yields something like ζ(2). For ζ(3): ∫∫∫ (x(1-x)y(1-y)z(1-z))/(1-xyz) dx dy dz yields ζ(3). For ζ(5), perhaps we need a 5-dimensional integral? But Beukers also gave a general integral for ζ(n) for any n: ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (∏_{i=1}^n x_i(1-x_i))/(1 - ∏ x_i) dx_1...dx_n yields something like ζ(n)? Actually the integral representation: ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (dx_1 ... dx_n)/(1 - x_1...x_n) = ζ(n). But that's not exactly; we need to check: ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (dx_1 ... dx_n)/(1 - x_1 ... x_n) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^n = ζ(n). Indeed ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (x_1...x_n)^{k-1} dx_1...dx_n = 1/k^n, so the series expansion yields ζ(n). So we have an integral representation. But to get rational approximations with small denominators, we need to introduce polynomial factors that produce factorials and denominators. Beukers used Legendre polynomials to get approximations for ζ(2) and ζ(3). For ζ(2), he used ∫_0^1∫_0^1 P_n(x) P_n(y) / (1 - xy) dx dy. For ζ(3), ∫_0^1∫_0^1∫_0^1 P_n(x) P_n(y) P_n(z) / (1 - xyz) dx dy dz. Here P_n are shifted Legendre polynomials P_n(x) = (1/n!) d^n/dx^n (x^n (1-x)^n). These have integer coefficients and are orthogonal. The integrals produce rational numbers with denominators dividing something like lcm(1..n)^something. This yields approximations to ζ(3) with error about ((√5-1)/2)^{5n}? Actually for ζ(3) the error decays like (√2 - 1)^4? Something like that. For ζ(5), one could try ∫_0^1 ... (5 times) P_n(x1)...P_n(x5) / (1 - x1 x2 x3 x4 x5) dx1...dx5. This yields linear forms in 1 and ζ(5) with rational coefficients. Possibly we can analyze the size of these integrals and denominators to get irrationality. But it's not straightforward; the approximations might not be good enough to force irrationality. Indeed, one can define A_n = ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (P_n(x1)...P_n(x5))/(1 - x1...x5) dx1...dx5. This can be expressed as sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^5 * (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx)^5. The inner integral is something like (1/k) * something like a rational combination of binomial coefficients. Actually ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = something like (k-n-1 choose n) / (k choose n) maybe? We need to recall: P_n(x) = ∑_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \binom{n}{i} \binom{n+i}{i} x^i? Wait shifted Legendre polynomial: P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+k}{k} (-1)^{n-k} x^k? Actually Legendre polynomials orthogonal on [0,1] are given by P_n(x) = \frac{1}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x^n(1-x)^n). This yields integer coefficients. Its expansion: P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{n-k} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+k}{k} x^k. Or something like that. Then ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx can be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients. In Beukers' proof for ζ(3), the resulting linear forms are A_n ζ(3) + B_n where A_n, B_n are integers with denominator dividing something like d_n^3 where d_n = lcm(1,...,n). The growth of d_n is about e^n. The error term decays like something like (√2 - 1)^{4n} maybe. The crucial inequality needed for irrationality is that |A_n ζ(3) + B_n| < 1 / (denominator) maybe? Actually for proving irrationality, we need to show there exist integer sequences p_n, q_n such that |ζ(3) - p_n/q_n| < 1/q_n^{1+δ} for some δ>0, i.e., that ζ(3) has an irrationality measure less than something. Apéry's proof gave that ζ(3) is irrational by showing existence of two integer sequences a_n, b_n such that a_n ζ(3) - b_n → 0 and that the denominators are not too large relative to the error, and that a_n ζ(3) - b_n ≠ 0 infinitely often, implying irrationality. More precisely, if we have integer sequences p_n, q_n with q_n ζ(3) - p_n → 0 and q_n ζ(3) - p_n ≠ 0 for all sufficiently large n, then ζ(3) is irrational. So we need to produce integer sequences approximating ζ(5) with similar properties.

The Beukers-type integral for ζ(5) would give sequences A_n ζ(5) + B_n = I_n where I_n is some integral that is small. A_n and B_n are rational numbers with denominators dividing some power of d_n. Multiplying by appropriate common denominator yields integer linear forms. But the smallness of I_n might not be enough to beat the denominator growth. For ζ(3), the smallness is about (√2 - 1)^{4n} ~ 0.03^n? Actually (√2-1)^4 ≈ (0.4142)^4 ≈ 0.029. For ζ(5), maybe the smallness is about something like (something)^n? Possibly (√5-1)/2? Not sure. But perhaps the exponent of the error is not small enough relative to denominator growth. The denominator d_n grows like e^n, and the error decays like c^n where c maybe around 0.1? e^n grows faster than any c^n? Actually e^n is exponential with base e ≈ 2.718, so e^n grows faster than any c^n if c<e. So we need error to be super-exponentially smaller than denominator? Wait need to compare after clearing denominators. Suppose we have rational approximations p_n/q_n to ζ(5) such that |ζ(5) - p_n/q_n| < 1/q_n^{1+δ} for some δ>0. Then irrationality follows. Typically, q_n grows like something like d_n^something, which is about e^{cn}. The error from the integral is about λ^n for some λ<1. So we get |ζ(5) - p_n/q_n| ~ λ^n. Meanwhile q_n ~ e^{α n} for some α>0. Then λ^n = (e^{log λ})^n = e^{n log λ}. Since log λ is negative, λ^n = e^{-β n} with β = -log λ >0. So the error is e^{-β n}. And q_n = e^{α n}. So 1/q_n^{1+δ} would be e^{-α(1+δ)n}. For the inequality to hold for some δ>0, we need e^{-β n} < e^{-α(1+δ)n} => β > α(1+δ). Since δ can be arbitrarily small positive, we need β > α. That is, the exponential decay rate β must be larger than the exponential growth rate α of the denominator. So we need λ < e^{-α}. So we need the error to be smaller than the reciprocal of the denominator (in exponent). For ζ(3), the denominator after clearing is d_n^3 ~ e^{3n}, so α = 3. The error is about (√2-1)^{4n} ≈ 0.0294^n = e^{n log 0.0294} = e^{-3.521 n}. So β ≈ 3.521 > α = 3, so condition holds, giving irrationality measure < something. For ζ(5), if we try similar integral with P_n^5, the denominator after clearing might be d_n^5? Actually A_n and B_n will have denominators like d_n^5? Let's examine: In Beukers' ζ(3) proof, the integral I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1∫_0^1 (P_n(x)P_n(y)P_n(z))/(1-xyz) dx dy dz yields A_n ζ(3) + B_n = I_n, where A_n = a_n, B_n = b_n are rational numbers with denominators dividing d_n^3. Actually we need to be precise: The integral can be expressed as sum_{k=1}^∞ (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx)^3. The inner integral yields something like (k-n-1 choose n)/(k choose n) maybe? Actually we can compute: ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = (1/k) * something like a rational number with denominator dividing something. But more concretely, Beukers showed that the numbers a_n = ∑_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k}^2 are integers, and the linear forms are a_n ζ(3) - b_n = O( (√2 - 1)^{4n} ) where b_n are integers. Wait that's Apéry's sequences. Beukers' integral yields similar sequences. For ζ(5), we would get something like A_n ζ(5) + B_n = ∑_{k=1}^∞ (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx)^5. The inner integral is rational with denominator dividing something like d_n? Possibly denominator dividing d_n? Actually ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = \frac{1}{k} \frac{Q_n(k)}{R_n(k)}? Not sure.

But there is known difficulty: For ζ(5), the natural generalization of Apéry's construction yields approximations that are not "good enough" to prove irrationality; the error decays like (something)^n but denominator grows like e^{c n} with c larger relative to decay exponent? Actually we need to compute. The denominator after clearing might be d_n^5? Let's try to estimate. In Beukers' ζ(3) case, after multiplying by d_n^3 we get integers. The error after multiplication is about d_n^3 * λ^n. Since d_n ~ e^n, d_n^3 ~ e^{3n}. λ^n = e^{n log λ} where log λ negative. So product is e^{n(3 + log λ)}. For irrationality we need this product to tend to zero, i.e., 3 + log λ < 0 => λ < e^{-3}. For ζ(3), λ ≈ 0.0294, and e^{-3} ≈ 0.0498, so λ < e^{-3} holds. For ζ(5), if we multiply by d_n^5, we need λ < e^{-5} ≈ 0.0067. Is the error from the 5-dimensional integral small enough? Possibly not. The error might be about (√2 - 1)^{something n}? Actually we need to compute the asymptotic of I_n = ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (P_n(x1)...P_n(x5))/(1 - x1...x5) dx. Using the series expansion, I_n = ∑_{k=1}^∞ (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx)^5. The inner integral is known to be about (√2 - 1)^{2n} / sqrt(n) maybe? Actually we can compute the asymptotics: For large k, the integral decays. But the sum's dominant term is from the tail? Let's recall that in Beukers' ζ(3) case, I_n ~ c (√2 - 1)^{4n}. Where does 4 come from? Because ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx behaves like something like λ^n for k near something? Actually the asymptotic arises from evaluating the integral via contour integrals or using generating functions. The factor (√2-1)^{4n} appears. For ζ(5), one might get (√2-1)^{something*n} with exponent maybe 6? Not sure. Let's attempt to derive: The integral I_n = ∑_{k=1}^∞ a_{n,k}^5, where a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx. Known that a_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{(k-n-1)!}{(k-1)!} * something? Actually we can compute explicitly: P_n(x) = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} x^j. Then ∫_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} dx = 1/(j + k). So a_{n,k} = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{j + k}. This can be expressed as a rational number with denominator dividing something like lcm(1,...,n+k). But asymptotically for large n, the main contribution to the sum over k might come from k near n? Actually there is known formula: a_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k} \prod_{i=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{k}{i}\right) ??? Not exactly. There is known expression: ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = \frac{(k-n-1)! (k-1)!}{(k)! (k-1-n)!} ??? Let's derive properly.

Recall that P_n(x) = \frac{1}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x^n (1-x)^n). Using integration by parts, we can express ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = \frac{1}{n!} ∫_0^1 x^{k-1} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x^n (1-x)^n) dx = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} ∫_0^1 \frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x^{k-1}) x^n (1-x)^n dx, if we integrate by parts n times, assuming boundary terms vanish because x^n(1-x)^n and its derivatives vanish at endpoints. Then d^n/dx^n (x^{k-1}) = (k-1)(k-2)...(k-n) x^{k-1-n} = (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! x^{k-1-n}. So we get ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \frac{(k-1)!}{(k-n-1)!} ∫_0^1 x^{k-1-n} x^n (1-x)^n dx = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \frac{(k-1)!}{(k-n-1)!} ∫_0^1 x^{k-1} (1-x)^n dx? Wait: x^{k-1-n} * x^n = x^{k-1}. Yes. So we get ∫_0^1 x^{k-1} (1-x)^n dx. That's Beta(k, n+1) = (k-1)! n! / (k+n)!. So the integral equals: = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \frac{(k-1)!}{(k-n-1)!} * \frac{(k-1)! n!}{(k+n)!} = (-1)^n \frac{(k-1)!^2}{(k-n-1)! (k+n)!}.

But need to check: (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! is defined for k > n. For k ≤ n, the factorial ratio might be problematic; but we can define using Gamma function, but the integral representation with integration by parts requires that k > n to avoid singularities at x=0? Actually the integration by parts is valid for any k>0? Let's see: The boundary terms vanish because x^n(1-x)^n and its derivatives vanish at 0 and 1 for n≥1. The formula d^n/dx^n (x^{k-1}) is polynomial if k-1 is integer; if k-1 < n, then the nth derivative is zero (since derivative of order > degree yields zero). Indeed, if k-1 is integer and k-1 < n, then the nth derivative of x^{k-1} is zero. So the formula using factorial ratio (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! is zero when k-1 < n because the factorial of negative integer is undefined, but we can interpret the derivative as zero. So for k ≤ n, the expression should be zero. Indeed, ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ n? Possibly not zero, but maybe it's a rational number. Actually let's test small n: P_1(x) = 1 - 2x? Wait P_1(x) = d/dx (x(1-x)) = 1-2x. ∫_0^1 (1-2x) x^{k-1} dx = 1/k - 2/(k+1). For k=1, gives 1 - 1 = 0. For k=2, gives 1/2 - 2/3 = -1/6 ≠ 0. So not zero for k=2 > n? n=1, k=2 > 1, okay. For k=1, which is ≤ n (1 ≤ 1), we got 0. So maybe it's zero for k ≤ n? Let's test n=2: P_2(x) = (1/2) d^2/dx^2 (x^2(1-x)^2) = (1/2) d^2/dx^2 (x^2 - 2x^3 + x^4) = (1/2) (2 - 12x + 12x^2). Actually compute: derivative: first derivative: 2x - 6x^2 + 4x^3; second derivative: 2 - 12x + 12x^2. Divided by 2 gives 1 - 6x + 6x^2. So P_2(x) = 1 - 6x + 6x^2. Then ∫_0^1 P_2(x) x^{k-1} dx = 1/k - 6/(k+1) + 6/(k+2). For k=1: 1 - 6/2 + 6/3 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0. For k=2: 1/2 - 6/3 + 6/4 = 0.5 - 2 + 1.5 = 0. So for k=2, zero. For k=3: 1/3 - 6/4 + 6/5 ≈ 0.333 - 1.5 + 1.2 = 0.033... Not zero. So indeed for k ≤ n, the integral yields zero. That's a known property: P_n is orthogonal to polynomials of degree < n with respect to the weight 1? Actually Legendre polynomials on [0,1] satisfy ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^m dx = 0 for m < n. Because P_n is orthogonal to all polynomials of degree less than n w.r.t. the weight 1? I think shifted Legendre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the constant weight on [0,1], yes. So indeed ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^m dx = 0 for m < n. So for k-1 < n, i.e., k ≤ n, the integral is zero. Good.

Thus for k > n, we can use the integration by parts formula. Let's derive correctly: Starting from P_n(x) = (1/n!) d^n/dx^n (x^n (1-x)^n). Then for any smooth test function f(x), integration by parts n times yields ∫_0^1 P_n(x) f(x) dx = (1/n!) ∫_0^1 f(x) d^n/dx^n (x^n(1-x)^n) dx = (-1)^n / n! ∫_0^1 f^{(n)}(x) x^n (1-x)^n dx, provided boundary terms vanish. This is valid if f is n-times differentiable. Taking f(x) = x^{k-1}, we have f^{(n)}(x) = (k-1)(k-2)...(k-n) x^{k-1-n} = (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! x^{k-1-n} if k-1 ≥ n; if k-1 < n, then f^{(n)}(x) = 0 (since derivative of order > degree is zero). So indeed for k ≤ n, the integral is zero. For k > n, we have:

∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = (-1)^n / n! * (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! ∫_0^1 x^{k-1-n} x^n (1-x)^n dx = (-1)^n / n! * (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! ∫_0^1 x^{k-1} (1-x)^n dx.

Now ∫_0^1 x^{k-1} (1-x)^n dx = B(k, n+1) = (k-1)! n! / (k+n)!. So plugging in:

= (-1)^n / n! * (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! * (k-1)! n! / (k+n)! = (-1)^n * (k-1)!^2 / ((k-n-1)! (k+n)!).

Thus a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx = (-1)^n \frac{((k-1)!)^2}{(k-n-1)! (k+n)!} for k > n, and 0 for k ≤ n.

That's a clean expression. Good.

Now we can examine I_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^∞ a_{n,k}^5 (since terms up to n are zero). So I_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^∞ [(-1)^n ((k-1)!)^2 / ((k-n-1)! (k+n)!)]^5 = ∑_{k=n+1}^∞ ((k-1)!)^{10} / ((k-n-1)!^{5} (k+n)!^{5}) (the sign factor becomes (-1)^{5n} = (-1)^n? Actually (-1)^n to the 5th power = (-1)^{5n} = (-1)^n because 5 odd. So sign = (-1)^n. But absolute value we care about.

Thus I_n = (-1)^n ∑_{k=n+1}^∞ ((k-1)!)^{10} / ((k-n-1)!^{5} (k+n)!^{5}).

We can shift index: let j = k - n - 1, then k = n+1+j, with j ≥ 0. Then k-1 = n + j. So ((k-1)!)^2 = (n+j)!^2? Actually (k-1)! = (n+j)! . (k-n-1)! = j! . (k+n)! = (2n+1+j)! . So a_{n,k} = (-1)^n ( (n+j)! )^2 / ( j! (2n+1+j)! ). Then a_{n,k}^5 = (-1)^n ( (n+j)! )^{10} / ( j!^5 (2n+1+j)!^5 ). So I_n = (-1)^n ∑_{j=0}^∞ ( (n+j)! )^{10} / ( j!^5 (2n+1+j)!^5 ).

Now we can factor out something like (n!)^{10} / ((2n+1)!)^5 times a hypergeometric series. Let's try: (n+j)! = (n+j)!/n! * n!. So (n+j)!^{10} = n!^{10} * ((n+j)!/n!)^{10} = n!^{10} * ( (n+1)(n+2)...(n+j) )^{10} = n!^{10} * ( (n+1)^{10} (n+2)^{10} ... (n+j)^{10} ). Similarly, (2n+1+j)! = (2n+1)! * (2n+2)(2n+3)...(2n+1+j). Actually (2n+1+j)! = (2n+1)! * ∏_{i=1}^{j} (2n+1+i). So (2n+1+j)!^5 = (2n+1)!^5 * ∏_{i=1}^{j} (2n+1+i)^5. And j!^5 is j!^5.

Thus I_n = (-1)^n n!^{10} / (2n+1)!^5 * ∑_{j=0}^∞ (∏_{i=1}^{j} (n+i)^{10}) / (j!^5 ∏_{i=1}^{j} (2n+1+i)^5). This sum looks like a generalized hypergeometric series _5F_4 maybe. Indeed, we can write term for j: T_j = ( (n+1)^{10} ... (n+j)^{10} ) / ( (2n+2)^5 (2n+3)^5 ... (2n+1+j)^5 * j!^5 ). But careful: product for denominator: ∏_{i=1}^{j} (2n+1+i)^5 = (2n+2)(2n+3)...(2n+1+j) each to power 5. So T_j = (∏_{i=1}^{j} (n+i)^{10}) / (∏_{i=1}^{j} (2n+1+i)^5 * j!^5). This is reminiscent of a hypergeometric term with rising factorials.

Define Pochhammer symbols: (a)_j = a(a+1)...(a+j-1). Then (n+1)_j = (n+1)(n+2)...(n+j). But we have product of (n+i)^{10}, which is (n+1)_j^{10}. Similarly denominator product of (2n+2)_j^5? Actually (2n+2)_j = (2n+2)(2n+3)...(2n+1+j). That's exactly our denominator product but starting at 2n+2, not 2n+1+i? Our denominator product is (2n+2)(2n+3)...(2n+1+j). Yes that's (2n+2)_j. So denominator includes (2n+2)_j^5. Also we have j!^5 = (1)_j^5. So T_j = ( (n+1)_j^{10} ) / ( (1)_j^5 (2n+2)_j^5 ). So the sum ∑_{j=0}^∞ T_j is a hypergeometric series: ∑_{j=0}^∞ ((n+1)_j^{10}) / ((1)_j^5 (2n+2)_j^5). That's a generalized hypergeometric series with 5 numerator parameters all equal to n+1 (ten of them? Actually we have 10 copies of (n+1)_j in numerator, but we can treat as (n+1)_j raised to 10, which is not standard hypergeometric notation because standard notation has product of Pochhammer symbols in numerator and denominator. Here we have (n+1)_j^{10} meaning ten copies of (n+1)_j multiplied together. That's equivalent to having 10 numerator parameters each equal to n+1. Similarly denominator has 5 copies of (1)_j and 5 copies of (2n+2)_j. So it's a _5+10? Actually a generalized hypergeometric series _pF_q has numerator parameters a1,...,ap and denominator parameters b1,...,bq, and term is ∏ (a_i)_j / (∏ (b_i)_j * j!). But we also have j! in denominator; here we have (1)_j^5 which is (1)_j^5 = (j!)^5? Actually (1)_j = j!. So (1)_j^5 = (j!)^5. So indeed (1)_j^5 * j!^? Wait our term already includes j!^5 in denominator. So we can represent as:

T_j = ( (n+1)_j^{10} ) / ( (1)_j^5 (2n+2)_j^5 ) = ∏_{i=1}^{10} (n+1)_j / ( ∏_{i=1}^{5} (1)_j * ∏_{i=1}^{5} (2n+2)_j ). Then we can write the series as _10F_9? Actually the standard form is _pF_q( a_1,...,a_p; b_1,...,b_q; z ) = ∑_{j=0}^∞ (a_1)_j ... (a_p)_j / ( (b_1)_j ... (b_q)_j * j! ) z^j. Here we have denominator includes (1)_j^5 (2n+2)_j^5, but we also need a factor of j! in denominator. But (1)_j = j!; so (1)_j^5 includes (j!)^5. So if we write denominator as (1)_j^5 (2n+2)_j^5, then we have an extra factor of (j!)^5, but the standard form expects only one j! factor. So we need to adjust. Actually we can incorporate the extra (j!)^4 into denominator parameters by adding parameters equal to 1? Let's see: The term in standard hypergeometric series is (a1)_j...(ap)_j / ((b1)_j...(bq)_j * j!). If we set denominator parameters appropriately, we could represent (j!)^5 as (1)_j^5, but then we have an extra factor of j! that is part of the standard denominator. So the term would be (a1)_j.../((b1)_j... * j!). If we set denominator parameters to include (1)_j^5, then the term would have (1)_j^5 in denominator and an extra j! factor. That gives total (j!)^6? Wait (1)_j = j!, so (1)_j^5 = (j!)^5. Multiply by the standard j! gives (j!)^6. But we need (j!)^5. So we need to have denominator such that the total power of j! is 5. This can be done by having denominator parameters that include (1)_j^4 and then rely on the standard j! to give the 5th. For example, we could set denominator parameters: 5 copies of (1)_j? Then term becomes (a's)_j / ((1)_j^5 * j!) = (j!)^5 * j! = (j!)^6, too many. If we set denominator parameters: 4 copies of (1)_j, then term denominator is (1)_j^4 * j! = (j!)^5, which matches. So we could represent T_j as (n+1)_j^{10} / ( (1)_j^4 (2n+2)_j^5 * j! ). But we also have (2n+2)_j^5. So we can define a hypergeometric series with 10 numerator parameters all n+1, and 4+5=9 denominator parameters: four 1's and five (2n+2). Then the term is (n+1)_j^{10} / ((1)_j^4 (2n+2)_j^5 * j!). That yields denominator factor (j!)^4 * j! = (j!)^5, which matches T_j. But we also have (1)_j^4 factor, not (1)_j^5. So we need to check: Our T_j has denominator (1)_j^5 (2n+2)_j^5. If we want to express it as (n+1)_j^{10} / ((1)_j^4 (2n+2)_j^5 * j!), that gives denominator (1)_j^4 * j! * (2n+2)_j^5 = (j!)^4 * j! * (2n+2)_j^5 = (j!)^5 (2n+2)_j^5. That's exactly T_j's denominator. Good! So we can write:

∑_{j=0}^∞ T_j = _10F_9( n+1, n+1, ..., n+1 (10 times); 1,1,1,1, 2n+2, 2n+2, 2n+2, 2n+2, 2n+2; 1 ). Actually we need 10 numerator parameters, 9 denominator parameters? The standard _pF_q has p numerator parameters and q denominator parameters, and term includes division by j!. If we have 9 denominator parameters, then term denominator is (b1)_j...(b9)_j * j!. So we need 9 denominator parameters: four 1's and five (2n+2). That's total 9. So it's _10F_9. Good.

Thus I_n = (-1)^n n!^{10} / (2n+1)!^5 * _10F_9( [n+1 repeated 10 times]; [1,1,1,1, 2n+2 (five times)]; 1 ).

But that's not crucial; we need asymptotics.

We can attempt to approximate I_n as n → ∞. The sum is dominated by terms where j is of order n perhaps? For large n, the terms might behave like something decaying with n. There is known result: For ζ(3), I_n = O( (√2 - 1)^{4n} ). For ζ(5), maybe I_n = O( λ^{c n} ) with λ maybe (√2-1)^{something}. But we need to compute.

Alternatively, we can estimate a_{n,k} for large n and k scaling with n. Let's set k = n + t, with t large relative to n? Actually we can use Stirling approximations. Let's define k = n + m, with m large. But we can find the maximum of |a_{n,k}| as function of k for fixed n. Then the sum of fifth powers maybe dominated by the largest term times number of terms. But the sum may be approximated by an integral. However, we need the exponential rate of decay of I_n as n → ∞. Possibly it's something like (√5-1)/2 raised to some power? Not sure.

We can attempt to compute the asymptotics of a_{n,k} using Stirling: (k-1)!^2 / ((k-n-1)! (k+n)!). Write k = n + j + 1? Actually we already have a_{n,k} = (-1)^n (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!). Where j = k-n-1. So a_{n,k} = (-1)^n A_{n,j} with A_{n,j} = (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!). Then I_n = ∑_{j=0}^∞ A_{n,j}^5.

Now we can use Stirling: log A_{n,j} = 2 log (n+j)! - log j! - log (2n+1+j)!.

We can treat n large, and j may scale with n. Let’s set j = α n, with α ≥ 0. Then use Stirling: log m! ≈ m log m - m + 1/2 log(2π m). Then

log A_{n,j} ≈ 2[(n+j) log (n+j) - (n+j) + 1/2 log(2π (n+j))] - [j log j - j + 1/2 log(2π j)] - [(2n+1+j) log (2n+1+j) - (2n+1+j) + 1/2 log(2π (2n+1+j))].

Simplify: ≈ 2(n+j) log (n+j) - 2(n+j) + log(2π (n+j)) - j log j + j - 1/2 log(2π j) - (2n+1+j) log (2n+1+j) + (2n+1+j) - 1/2 log(2π (2n+1+j)).

Combine linear terms: -2(n+j) + j + (2n+1+j) = -2n - 2j + j + 2n + 1 + j = ( -2n -2j + j + 2n + 1 + j ) = 1. So linear terms sum to 1. Good. So we get:

log A_{n,j} ≈ 2(n+j) log (n+j) - j log j - (2n+1+j) log (2n+1+j) + 1 + (log(2π (n+j)) - 1/2 log(2π j) - 1/2 log(2π (2n+1+j))).

The constant 1 is there. The log terms from Stirling's constant part: Actually we should include the 1/2 log(2π m) for each factorial. For (n+j)! we have +1/2 log(2π (n+j)). Since we have 2 times that, we get + log(2π (n+j)). For j! we have -1/2 log(2π j). For (2n+1+j)! we have -1/2 log(2π (2n+1+j)). So the sum is as above.

Now define n large, j = α n. Then we can approximate the logs:

Let n+j = n(1+α). 2n+1+j ≈ n(2+α). j = α n. Then:

2(n+j) log (n+j) ≈ 2n(1+α) [log n + log(1+α)].
j log j ≈ α n (log n + log α).
(2n+1+j) log (2n+1+j) ≈ n(2+α) [log n + log(2+α)].

So the leading term (coefficient of n log n) is: 2(1+α) - α - (2+α) = 2+2α - α - 2 - α = 0. So the n log n term cancels, which is expected because A_{n,j} decays exponentially in n when α fixed? Actually we need to see the leading term is O(n). Indeed after cancellation, we get terms of order n (without log n). Let's compute the next terms: we have contributions from the logs of (1+α), α, (2+α) multiplied by n. So:

log A_{n,j} ≈ n[ 2(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - (2+α) log(2+α) ] + 1 + lower order terms (like 1/2 log terms). So we get:

log A_{n,j} ≈ n f(α) + O(log n), where

f(α) = 2(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - (2+α) log(2+α).

Then A_{n,j} ≈ exp( n f(α) ) times polynomial factors.

Now I_n = ∑_{j=0}^∞ A_{n,j}^5 ≈ ∑_{j} exp( 5 n f(α) ). For large n, the sum is dominated by the maximum of f(α) over α ≥ 0, because the exponential factor will be largest where f(α) is maximal. However note that A_{n,j} may be small; f(α) is negative for all α? Let's examine f(α). For α=0, we need to treat carefully because j=0 corresponds to α=0. But the formula for A_{n,0} = (n)!^2 / (0! (2n+1)!) = (n!)^2 / (2n+1)!. Using Stirling, we can compute log A_{n,0} ≈ n[2 log n - 2 - ( (2n) log (2n) - 2n )? Actually (2n+1)! ~ (2n)! (2n+1) but asymptotically (2n)! ~ (2n) log(2n) - 2n. Let's compute: log A_{n,0} ≈ 2 (n log n - n) - ( (2n) log (2n) - 2n ) = 2n log n - 2n - 2n log (2n) + 2n = 2n log n - 2n log (2n) = 2n (log n - log(2n)) = 2n (log n - log 2 - log n) = -2n log 2. So f(0) = -2 log 2 ≈ -1.3863. But our expression for f(α) at α=0: need to take limit as α→0. Let's compute f(α) = 2(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - (2+α) log(2+α). As α→0, 2(1+α) log(1+α) → 2*1*0 = 0. α log α → 0 (since α log α → 0). (2+α) log(2+α) → 2 log 2. So f(0) = -2 log 2. That matches.

Now f(α) for α>0. We can analyze its maximum. Since A_{n,j} decays as n increases if f(α) < 0 for all α, the sum I_n will be exponentially small in n. The rate of decay of I_n will be determined by the supremum of exp(5 n f(α)) times maybe a polynomial factor from the number of terms (which is O(n) because j runs up to infinity, but the dominant contribution comes from a region around the α that maximizes f(α). However note that f(α) is negative for all α, because A_{n,j} is less than 1 for large n? Possibly the maximum (least negative) is at some α>0? Let's compute derivative to see if f(α) has a maximum at some α>0. Compute f'(α) = derivative:

f(α) = 2(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - (2+α) log(2+α).

Compute derivative term by term:

d/dα [2(1+α) log(1+α)] = 2[1 * log(1+α) + (1+α) * (1/(1+α))] = 2[log(1+α) + 1] = 2 log(1+α) + 2.

d/dα [ - α log α] = -[1*log α + α*(1/α)] = -[log α + 1] = -log α - 1.

d/dα [ - (2+α) log(2+α)] = -[1*log(2+α) + (2+α)*(1/(2+α))] = -[log(2+α) + 1] = -log(2+α) - 1.

So f'(α) = 2 log(1+α) + 2 - log α - 1 - log(2+α) - 1 = 2 log(1+α) - log α - log(2+α) + (2 - 1 - 1) = 2 log(1+α) - log α - log(2+α).

Simplify: f'(α) = log( (1+α)^2 / (α (2+α)) ). Set f'(α)=0 => (1+α)^2 = α (2+α) => 1 + 2α + α^2 = 2α + α^2 => 1 + 2α + α^2 = 2α + α^2 => 1 = 0. That's impossible. So f'(α) never zero? Wait we might have made an algebraic mistake: Expand (1+α)^2 = 1 + 2α + α^2. α(2+α) = 2α + α^2. Subtract: (1+2α+α^2) - (2α+α^2) = 1. So indeed (1+α)^2 = α(2+α) + 1. So (1+α)^2 / (α(2+α)) = 1 + 1/(α(2+α)). That's > 1, so f'(α) = log( something > 1 ) > 0 for all α > 0? Actually need to check domain: α>0, α(2+α)>0, so (1+α)^2/(α(2+α)) > 1, so its log is positive. So f'(α) > 0 for all α > 0. That means f(α) is strictly increasing for α>0. But we need to check limit as α→∞. As α → ∞, we can approximate: f(α) ≈ 2α log α - α log α - α log α? Let's compute asymptotically: for large α, log(1+α) ~ log α + log(1+1/α) ~ log α + 1/α - ...; (1+α) ~ α. So 2(1+α) log(1+α) ~ 2α (log α + 1/α) = 2α log α + 2. α log α stays as α log α. (2+α) log(2+α) ~ α (log α + 2/α) = α log α + 2. So f(α) ~ (2α log α + 2) - α log α - (α log α + 2) = 2α log α + 2 - α log α - α log α - 2 = 0. So f(α) → 0 as α → ∞. Since f(α) is increasing (f'>0) and tends to 0 from below? At α large, f(α) approaches 0 from below? Let's check numeric: For α=10, compute f(10) roughly: 2*11*log(11)=22*2.3979=52.755? Actually 2(1+α)=22, log(1+α)=log11≈2.3979, product≈52.755; α log α=10*log10≈10*2.3026=23.026; (2+α)log(2+α)=12*log12≈12*2.4849=29.819; f=52.755-23.026-29.819=-0.09. So f(10)≈ -0.09, negative, close to 0. As α→∞, f(α)→0-. Since f is increasing, it must be that f(α) < 0 for all finite α, approaching 0 as α→∞. At α=0, f(0) = -2 log 2 ≈ -1.386. So the maximum (supremum) is 0, attained only as α→∞. But as α→∞, j = α n, but j cannot be infinite; the sum over j goes to infinity, but the terms A_{n,j} for large j (i.e., j >> n) might not be negligible? Actually as α→∞, f(α) approaches 0 from below, meaning log A_{n,j} ~ n f(α) where f(α) is close to 0 for large α. So for very large j relative to n, A_{n,j} decays slowly? Let's examine A_{n,j} for j >> n: using the expression A_{n,j} = (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!). For large j with n fixed, we can approximate: (n+j)! ~ j! * j^n (by ratio of factorials). Actually (n+j)! / j! ~ j^n (as j large). Similarly, (2n+1+j)! ~ j! * j^{2n+1}. So A_{n,j} ~ (j!^2 * j^{2n}) / (j! * j! * j^{2n+1})? Wait compute: (n+j)!^2 ≈ (j! * j^n)^2 = j!^2 * j^{2n}. (2n+1+j)! ≈ j! * j^{2n+1}. So A_{n,j} ≈ (j!^2 * j^{2n}) / (j! * j! * j^{2n+1}) = 1/j. So for large j, A_{n,j} ~ 1/j. Indeed, as j → ∞, A_{n,j} ~ 1/j. That's consistent with the asymptotic we derived: f(α) → 0 implies log A_{n,j} ~ n * 0 = constant? But careful: f(α) is defined for α = j/n, with n large and α large means j >> n. But in that regime, the approximation using scaling with n may not be valid because we assumed n large and j scaling with n; if j is much larger than n, then α is large, but we still can treat n large and α large; the asymptotic f(α) → 0 indicates that log A_{n,j} is o(n) perhaps? Actually f(α) ~ 0 for large α, but the expansion may break down because we used Stirling for all terms with n+j, j, 2n+1+j, assuming n and j are both large. For α large, we can approximate f(α) by series: f(α) = 2(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - (2+α) log(2+α). For large α, expand: log(1+α) = log α + log(1+1/α) = log α + 1/α - 1/(2α^2) + ...; similarly log(2+α) = log α + log(1+2/α) = log α + 2/α - 2/α^2 + ... Then compute:

2(1+α) log(1+α) = 2(α+1)(log α + 1/α - 1/(2α^2) + ...) = 2α log α + 2 log α + 2α*(1/α) + 2*(1/α) ... Let's compute systematically: (α+1)*(log α + 1/α - 1/(2α^2)+...) = α log α + α*(1/α) - α*(1/(2α^2)) + 1*log α + 1*(1/α) + ... = α log α + 1 - 1/(2α) + log α + 1/α + ... Then times 2 gives: 2α log α + 2 + 2 log α - 1/α + 2/α + ... Actually need to be careful: 2*(α log α) = 2α log α. 2*1 = 2. 2*(-1/(2α)) = -1/α. 2*log α = 2 log α. 2*(1/α) = 2/α. So sum = 2α log α + 2 log α + 2 + ( -1/α + 2/α ) + higher = 2α log α + 2 log α + 2 + 1/α + ... .

Now α log α term is α log α. (2+α) log(2+α) = (α+2)(log α + 2/α - 2/α^2 + ...) = α log α + α*(2/α) + 2 log α + 2*(2/α) + ... = α log α + 2 + 2 log α + 4/α + ... .

Now f = 2(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - (2+α) log(2+α) = (2α log α + 2 log α + 2 + 1/α + ...) - α log α - (α log α + 2 + 2 log α + 4/α + ...) = 2α log α + 2 log α + 2 + 1/α - α log α - α log α - 2 - 2 log α - 4/α + ... = (2α log α - α log α - α log α) + (2 log α - 2 log α) + (2 - 2) + (1/α - 4/α) + ... = 0 + 0 + 0 -3/α + ... . So f(α) ≈ -3/α for large α. That tends to 0 from below as 1/α. So indeed f(α) is negative and tends to 0 like -3/α. Then n f(α) ≈ -3n/α = -3n/(j/n) = -3n^2/j? Wait α = j/n, so n f(α) ≈ n * (-3/α) = -3n / (j/n) = -3 n^2 / j. So for j >> n^2, n f(α) becomes small? But j scaling with n^2 is beyond the scaling regime where α = j/n is large, but then f(α) approximation -3/α may be valid for α large but not too large relative to n? Actually if j is O(n^2), then α = j/n is O(n), which is large, and -3n/α = -3n/(j/n) = -3 n^2 / j. If j is comparable to n^2, then n f(α) is O(1). So for j ~ C n^2, A_{n,j} may not be exponentially small but only polynomial decay like something. Indeed, earlier we derived that for fixed n and j → ∞, A_{n,j} ~ 1/j. That suggests that the sum ∑ A_{n,j}^5 diverges if we sum over j to infinity? Because ∑ (1/j)^5 converges (p=5). So the sum I_n converges. For large n, the terms for j up to some range may be significant. The asymptotic of I_n as n → ∞ may be determined by the region where j is of order n^2? Because for j of order n, f(α) is O(1) negative, giving exponential decay exp( -c n). But for j of order n^2, α is large, and n f(α) ≈ -3 n^2 / j, which can be O(1) when j ~ n^2. So the terms with j ~ n^2 may contribute significantly. Let's analyze more precisely.

We need to approximate A_{n,j} for large n and j possibly up to ∞. The expression A_{n,j} = (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!). We can try to write it in terms of binomial coefficients: (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!) = \frac{(n+j)!^2}{(2n+1+j)! j!} = \frac{1}{(2n+1+j) \binom{2n+1+j}{n+j}}? Not exactly. Let's see: \binom{2n+1+j}{n+j} = \frac{(2n+1+j)!}{(n+j)! (n+1)!}? Actually (2n+1+j)! / ((n+j)! (n+1)!). That's not directly. Alternatively, we can express A_{n,j} = \frac{(n+j)!}{(2n+1+j)!} \cdot \frac{(n+j)!}{j!} = \frac{(n+j)!}{(2n+1+j)!} \cdot \frac{(n+j)!}{j!}. The second factor is \frac{(n+j)!}{j!} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (j+i). The first factor is 1/[(2n+1+j)(2n+j)...(n+j+1)]? Actually (2n+1+j)!/(n+j)! = ∏_{k=1}^{n+1} (n+j+k). So (n+j)!/(2n+1+j)! = 1/∏_{k=1}^{n+1} (n+j+k). So A_{n,j} = \frac{∏_{i=1}^{n} (j+i)}{∏_{k=1}^{n+1} (n+j+k)}. That is a rational function. For large j, A_{n,j} ~ (j^n)/(j^{n+1}) = 1/j, as before.

Now I_n = ∑_{j=0}^∞ A_{n,j}^5. For large n, the main contribution may come from j around n^2? Let's examine scaling. Write j = t n^2. Then we can approximate A_{n,j} using Stirling for large n and j scaling as n^2. Let's set j = λ n^2, with λ > 0 constant. Then n and j are both large, but j is much larger than n. We can apply Stirling approximations with parameters n and j. However, we need to handle factorials with arguments n+j and 2n+1+j which are both ~ j (since j dominates). We can approximate using Stirling's formula for each factorial, but we must be careful about the relative sizes.

Let’s set n large, j = λ n^2. Then n+j ~ λ n^2 + n ≈ λ n^2. j ~ λ n^2. 2n+1+j ~ λ n^2 + 2n ≈ λ n^2. So all arguments are of order n^2. Then log A_{n,j} = 2 log (n+j)! - log j! - log (2n+1+j)!.

We can apply Stirling: log m! = m log m - m + (1/2) log(2π m) + O(1/m). Then

log A = 2[(n+j) log(n+j) - (n+j) + 1/2 log(2π (n+j))] - [j log j - j + 1/2 log(2π j)] - [(2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j) - (2n+1+j) + 1/2 log(2π (2n+1+j))] + O(1/(n+j), etc).

Simplify linear terms: -2(n+j) + j + (2n+1+j) = -2n -2j + j + 2n + 1 + j = 1, as before. So

log A = 2(n+j) log(n+j) - j log j - (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j) + 1 + 1/2[2 log(2π (n+j)) - log(2π j) - log(2π (2n+1+j))] + o(1).

Now we can substitute n+j = j + n, 2n+1+j = j + 2n+1. Since j is huge compared to n, we can expand logs in terms of n/j. Write n+j = j (1 + n/j). 2n+1+j = j (1 + (2n+1)/j). Then

log(n+j) = log j + log(1 + n/j) = log j + n/j - n^2/(2j^2) + ...
log(2n+1+j) = log j + log(1 + (2n+1)/j) = log j + (2n+1)/j - (2n+1)^2/(2j^2) + ...

Also 2(n+j) log(n+j) = 2(j + n) (log j + n/j - n^2/(2j^2) + ...) = 2j log j + 2n log j + 2j*(n/j) + 2n*(n/j) - j n^2/j^2? Let's compute systematically.

2(n+j) log(n+j) = 2j (1 + n/j) * (log j + n/j - n^2/(2j^2) + ...) = 2j log j + 2j * (n/j) + 2j * (- n^2/(2j^2))? Actually expand: (1 + n/j) * (log j + n/j - n^2/(2j^2) + ...) = log j + n/j - n^2/(2j^2) + ... + (n/j) log j + (n/j)*(n/j) + ... = log j + n/j - n^2/(2j^2) + (n log j)/j + n^2/j^2 + higher. Then multiply by 2j: 2j * log j = 2j log j. 2j * (n/j) = 2n. 2j * (- n^2/(2j^2)) = - n^2/j. 2j * ((n log j)/j) = 2n log j. 2j * (n^2/j^2) = 2n^2/j. Then plus higher terms.

Similarly, -j log j is straightforward. - (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j) = -(j + 2n+1) (log j + (2n+1)/j - (2n+1)^2/(2j^2) + ...). Expand: = -j log j - j * ((2n+1)/j) - j * (-(2n+1)^2/(2j^2))? Actually careful: (j + 2n+1)*(log j + Δ) where Δ = (2n+1)/j - (2n+1)^2/(2j^2) + ... . Multiply: j log j + jΔ + (2n+1) log j + (2n+1)Δ. Then with minus sign: -(j log j) - jΔ - (2n+1) log j - (2n+1)Δ.

Now jΔ = j * ((2n+1)/j - (2n+1)^2/(2j^2) + ... ) = (2n+1) - (2n+1)^2/(2j) + ... . (2n+1)Δ = (2n+1) * ((2n+1)/j - (2n+1)^2/(2j^2) + ...) = (2n+1)^2/j - (2n+1)^3/(2j^2) + ... .

Thus - (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j) = -j log j - (2n+1) + (2n+1)^2/(2j) - (2n+1) log j - (2n+1)^2/j + ... (higher order). Actually we have -jΔ = -(2n+1) + (2n+1)^2/(2j) - ... . And -(2n+1)Δ = -(2n+1)^2/j + ... . So combine: -(2n+1) + (2n+1)^2/(2j) - (2n+1)^2/j + ... = -(2n+1) - (2n+1)^2/(2j) + ...? Wait (2n+1)^2/(2j) - (2n+1)^2/j = -(2n+1)^2/(2j). So indeed - (2n+1) - (2n+1)^2/(2j) + ... .

Now sum all contributions to log A: from 2(n+j) log(n+j) we have: 2j log j + 2n log j + 2n + (terms from expansion: - n^2/j + 2n^2/j + ...). Let's collect terms systematically:

We have:
Term A: 2(n+j) log(n+j) = 2j log j + 2n log j + 2n + ( - n^2/j + 2n^2/j )? Actually we computed contributions: from 2j*(n/j) gave 2n; from -n^2/j came from 2j*(- n^2/(2j^2))? Let's recalc more cleanly using series expansions.

Better approach: Use expansions with respect to small parameter ε = n/j. Since j is large relative to n, ε is small. Set n+j = j (1+ε). Then log(n+j) = log j + log(1+ε) = log j + ε - ε^2/2 + ε^3/3 - ... . Also 2(n+j) = 2j (1+ε). So 2(n+j) log(n+j) = 2j (1+ε) (log j + ε - ε^2/2 + ε^3/3 - ...) = 2j log j (1+ε) + 2j (1+ε)(ε - ε^2/2 + ε^3/3 - ...). Expand:

2j log j (1+ε) = 2j log j + 2j ε log j = 2j log j + 2n log j.

Now 2j (1+ε)(ε - ε^2/2 + ε^3/3 - ...) = 2j [ (ε - ε^2/2 + ε^3/3 - ...) + ε(ε - ε^2/2 + ε^3/3 - ...) ] = 2j [ ε - ε^2/2 + ε^3/3 - ... + ε^2 - ε^3/2 + ... ] = 2j [ ε + ( -1/2 + 1) ε^2 + (1/3 - 1/2) ε^3 + ... ] = 2j [ ε + (1/2) ε^2 + (-1/6) ε^3 + ... ].

Now ε = n/j, so 2j ε = 2n. 2j * (1/2) ε^2 = j * ε^2 = j * (n^2/j^2) = n^2/j. 2j * (-1/6) ε^3 = - (2j/6) ε^3 = -(j/3) ε^3 = -(j/3) * (n^3/j^3) = - n^3/(3 j^2). So we have contributions: 2n + n^2/j - n^3/(3j^2) + ... .

Thus 2(n+j) log(n+j) = 2j log j + 2n log j + 2n + n^2/j - n^3/(3j^2) + ... .

Now for - (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j), we set δ = (2n+1)/j. Then 2n+1+j = j (1+δ). log(2n+1+j) = log j + log(1+δ) = log j + δ - δ^2/2 + δ^3/3 - ... . Also (2n+1+j) = j (1+δ). So (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j) = j (1+δ) (log j + δ - δ^2/2 + δ^3/3 - ...) = j log j (1+δ) + j (1+δ)(δ - δ^2/2 + δ^3/3 - ...). Expand: j log j (1+δ) = j log j + j δ log j = j log j + (2n+1) log j. Next, j (1+δ)(δ - δ^2/2 + δ^3/3 - ...) = j [ (δ - δ^2/2 + δ^3/3 - ...) + δ(δ - δ^2/2 + δ^3/3 - ...) ] = j [ δ - δ^2/2 + δ^3/3 - ... + δ^2 - δ^3/2 + ... ] = j [ δ + ( -1/2 + 1) δ^2 + (1/3 - 1/2) δ^3 + ... ] = j [ δ + (1/2) δ^2 + (-1/6) δ^3 + ... ].

Now δ = (2n+1)/j, so j δ = 2n+1. j * (1/2) δ^2 = (j/2) δ^2 = (j/2) * ( (2n+1)^2 / j^2 ) = (2n+1)^2/(2j). j * (-1/6) δ^3 = -(j/6) δ^3 = -(j/6) * ( (2n+1)^3 / j^3 ) = -(2n+1)^3/(6 j^2). So (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j) = j log j + (2n+1) log j + (2n+1) + (2n+1)^2/(2j) - (2n+1)^3/(6 j^2) + ... .

Thus - (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j) = -j log j - (2n+1) log j - (2n+1) - (2n+1)^2/(2j) + (2n+1)^3/(6 j^2) + ... .

Now we also have - j log j term from the -j log j in the expression for log A. So sum all contributions:

2(n+j) log(n+j): +2j log j + 2n log j + 2n + n^2/j - n^3/(3 j^2) + ...
- j log j: - j log j
- (2n+1+j) log(2n+1+j): -j log j - (2n+1) log j - (2n+1) - (2n+1)^2/(2j) + (2n+1)^3/(6 j^2) + ...

Now combine the j log j terms: 2j log j - j log j - j log j = 0. Good, they cancel. Next, combine log j terms: 2n log j - (2n+1) log j = (2n - (2n+1)) log j = - log j. So we have a -log j term.

Next, combine constant (non-log) linear terms: from 2(n+j) log: +2n; from - (2n+1+j) log: -(2n+1). Also we have +1 from earlier constant (the +1 from the linear combination). So total constant: 2n - (2n+1) + 1 = 0. Good.

Now combine the 1/j terms: from 2(n+j) log: + n^2/j. From - (2n+1+j) log: - (2n+1)^2/(2j). So total: (n^2 - (2n+1)^2/2) / j. Also there may be contributions from the expansions of the 1/2 log(2π) terms? We'll include later. But the leading asymptotic of log A will be -log j + (something)/j + lower order.

Now also we have the 1/2 log terms: 1/2[2 log(2π (n+j)) - log(2π j) - log(2π (2n+1+j))] = log(2π (n+j)) - 1/2 log(2π j) - 1/2 log(2π (2n+1+j)). Expand for large j: n+j ~ j, 2n+1+j ~ j. So this is approximately log(2π j) - 1/2 log(2π j) - 1/2 log(2π j) = 0. Actually more precisely: log(2π (n+j)) = log(2π j) + log(1 + n/j) = log(2π j) + n/j - n^2/(2j^2)+... . -1/2 log(2π j) - 1/2 log(2π (2n+1+j)) = -1/2 log(2π j) - 1/2[log(2π j) + log(1+(2n+1)/j)] = - log(2π j) - 1/2 log(1+(2n+1)/j). So sum: log(2π j) + n/j - ... - log(2π j) - 1/2 log(1+(2n+1)/j) = n/j - ... - 1/2 log(1+(2n+1)/j). For large j, log(1+(2n+1)/j) ≈ (2n+1)/j - (2n+1)^2/(2j^2)+..., so -1/2 log(1+(2n+1)/j) ≈ -(2n+1)/(2j) + (2n+1)^2/(4j^2)+... . So the 1/2 log terms contribute at order 1/j: n/j - (2n+1)/(2j) = (2n - (2n+1))/ (2j) = -1/(2j). So the 1/2 log terms contribute -1/(2j) plus higher order. So we need to include that.

Thus log A = -log j + [n^2/j - (2n+1)^2/(2j) - 1/(2j) + ...] + o(1/j). Let's compute the coefficient of 1/j: n^2 - (2n+1)^2/2 - 1/2. Compute (2n+1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1. So (2n+1)^2/2 = 2n^2 + 2n + 0.5. Then n^2 - (2n^2 + 2n + 0.5) - 0.5 = n^2 - 2n^2 - 2n - 0.5 - 0.5 = -n^2 - 2n - 1. So the 1/j term is (-n^2 - 2n - 1)/j. That seems to be large negative when n is large, but note that j is huge, maybe j ~ λ n^2, so (n^2)/j ~ 1/λ. So this term is O(1). So we need to keep it.

Thus log A = -log j - (n^2 + 2n + 1)/j + ... plus constant? Wait we also have contributions from higher order terms (1/j^2 etc) which may be significant when j ~ n^2 because n^3/j^2 ~ n^3/(n^4) ~ 1/n, small. So the dominant terms for log A when j is of order n^2 are -log j - (n^2)/j * (1 + o(1)). Let's be more systematic.

Set j = λ n^2. Then n/j = 1/(λ n), δ = (2n+1)/j ≈ 2n/(λ n^2) = 2/(λ n). So ε and δ are small of order 1/n. Then expansions above give log A as series in 1/n. We can compute log A up to O(1) terms as n → ∞ with λ fixed.

We have: log A = -log j + C0 + C1/j + C2/j^2 + ... plus the 1/2 log terms contributions. But the constant term (independent of n) might arise from the 1/2 log terms and from the O(1) from expansions? We need to compute the constant term (i.e., term that does not vanish as n→∞ when λ fixed). Since j = λ n^2, log j = log λ + 2 log n. So -log j = -2 log n - log λ. This diverges as log n, which is large positive? Actually -log j is negative large? Wait -log j = -(log λ + 2 log n) = -2 log n - log λ. As n→∞, this goes to -∞. So log A → -∞, meaning A decays to zero. But we need A^5, so the sum I_n may be dominated by terms where j is not too large such that A is not too tiny. But -log j term gives factor 1/j, which already suggests A ~ 1/j times some exponential factor in n? Actually -log j yields factor 1/j in A (since A = exp(log A) ~ exp(-log j) * exp(other) = (1/j) * exp(other). So the leading factor is 1/j. Then we have additional exponential factor exp( - (n^2 + 2n + 1)/j + ... ). Since j is of order n^2, (n^2)/j = O(1). So exp( - (n^2)/j ) is some constant factor (like e^{-1/λ}). So A ~ C(λ)/j. Then A^5 ~ C(λ)^5 / j^5. Summing over j from 1 to ∞, with j ~ λ n^2, the sum approximates an integral over λ. As n grows, the discrete j values become dense in λ scale? Since j increments by 1, but λ changes by Δλ ≈ 1/n^2. So the sum approximates ∫ (something) dλ? Possibly leading to I_n ~ (1/n^2) * ∫ f(λ) dλ. But we need to determine the asymptotic order of I_n. If I_n decays like 1/n^2, then after multiplying by denominator d_n^5 (which is ~ e^{5n}), the product may still go to zero? Actually 1/n^2 is polynomial decay, not exponential. But the product d_n^5 * I_n would be ~ e^{5n} * (1/n^2). That diverges to infinity, not zero. So that approach would not give a small linear form. However, note that I_n itself is not the linear form; it's the integral that equals A_n ζ(5) + B_n. But A_n and B_n are rational numbers derived from the integral. In Beukers' method for ζ(3), the integral I_n is of order λ^n where λ < e^{-3}. That's exponential decay. For ζ(5), maybe the integral I_n decays only polynomially, not exponentially. That would be insufficient to prove irrationality using that method because after clearing denominators we would get a sequence that does not tend to zero, or tends to zero too slowly relative to denominator.

But is it true that I_n decays polynomially? Let's test numerically with small n to see trend. For n=1, I_1 = ∑_{j=0}∞ A_{1,j}^5 with A_{1,j} = (1+j)!^2 / (j! (3+j)!). Compute A_{1,j} = ((j+1)!)^2 / (j! (j+3)!). (j+1)! = (j+1) j!. So ((j+1)!)^2 = (j+1)^2 (j!)^2. Denominator: j! (j+3)! = j! * (j+3)(j+2)(j+1)j! = (j!)^2 (j+3)(j+2)(j+1). So A_{1,j} = (j+1)^2 / ((j+3)(j+2)(j+1)) = (j+1) / ((j+3)(j+2)). So A_{1,j} = (j+1)/((j+2)(j+3)). For large j, ~ 1/j. Then A_{1,j}^5 ~ 1/j^5, sum converges. I_1 = ∑_{j=0}∞ ((j+1)/((j+2)(j+3)))^5. That's some constant maybe around 0.01? Not extremely small. For n=2, A_{2,j} = (2+j)!^2 / (j! (5+j)!). That may be about (j+2)^2/( (j+5)(j+4)(j+3)?) Let's compute: (2+j)! = (j+2)!; (5+j)! = (j+5)!. Then A = ((j+2)!)^2 / (j! (j+5)!). Write (j+2)! = (j+2)(j+1)j!. So ((j+2)!)^2 = (j+2)^2 (j+1)^2 (j!)^2. Denominator: j! (j+5)! = j! * (j+5)(j+4)(j+3)(j+2)(j+1)j! = (j!)^2 (j+5)(j+4)(j+3)(j+2)(j+1). Cancel (j!)^2 and (j+1)(j+2). Then A = (j+2)(j+1) / ((j+5)(j+4)(j+3)). Actually check: numerator: (j+2)^2 (j+1)^2. Denominator: (j+5)(j+4)(j+3)(j+2)(j+1). Cancel one (j+2) and one (j+1): left with (j+2)(j+1) / ((j+5)(j+4)(j+3)). So A_{2,j} = (j+1)(j+2) / ((j+3)(j+4)(j+5)). For large j, ~ 1/j. So I_2 = ∑ ((j+1)(j+2) / ((j+3)(j+4)(j+5)))^5. This sum likely converges to some constant of order maybe 0.001? Not decaying with n as exponential; it seems to approach a limit? Actually as n increases, A_{n,j} for fixed j (small j) might become smaller. For n=1, A_{1,0} = 1/(2*3)=1/6≈0.1667. For n=2, A_{2,0} = (1*2)/(3*4*5)=2/60≈0.03333. So the terms for small j get smaller as n increases. But the tail for large j, where j scales with n^2, might contribute a significant portion. We need to examine asymptotic of I_n as n→∞.

Let's attempt to estimate I_n more systematically. We have I_n = ∑_{j=0}^∞ A_{n,j}^5, with A_{n,j} = (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!). Write A_{n,j} = \frac{(n+j)!}{(2n+1+j)!} \cdot \frac{(n+j)!}{j!}.

We can express A_{n,j} in terms of Beta integrals? Actually note that ∫_0^1 x^{j} (1-x)^n dx = j! n! / (j+n+1)!. But we have (n+j)! and (2n+1+j)!. Maybe there's relation to Beta functions: B(p,q) = ∫_0^1 x^{p-1} (1-x)^{q-1} dx = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p+q). If we set p = j+1, q = n+1, then Γ(p) = j!, Γ(q) = n!, Γ(p+q) = (j+n+1)!. So j! n! / (j+n+1)! = ∫_0^1 x^j (1-x)^n dx. That's similar to our expression but we have (n+j)! not n!. So not directly.

Alternatively, we can use hypergeometric functions as earlier. But perhaps there is a known result: The Beukers-type integral for ζ(5) yields I_n = O(1/n^2) or something. I recall some literature: In 2000, Rhin and Viola improved irrationality measures for ζ(3) and ζ(2) using similar integrals. For ζ(5), there have been attempts using "well-poised hypergeometric series" and "group theory" to produce linear forms in 1 and ζ(5) with better estimates. Zudilin's result that at least one of ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11) is irrational used a clever construction of linear forms with small coefficients. That approach used "multiple integrals" and "rational approximations" derived from hypergeometric sums. Possibly one could adapt that to target ζ(5) alone. But the problem asks to "find new approaches". So we need to propose some novel ideas, maybe using p-adic valuations, modular forms, L-functions, etc.

We could think about using the theory of periods and the conjecture that all periods are either transcendental or rational multiples of π? Not helpful.

Another angle: Use the theory of "modular forms" and "Eisenstein series". ζ(5) appears as a special value of the L-function associated to a modular form? Actually ζ(s) is the L-function of the trivial motive. But there are connections: The values of ζ at odd integers appear in periods of modular forms. For instance, ζ(3) appears in the volume of hyperbolic 3-manifolds? Not sure.

Maybe we can use the theory of "multiple zeta values" (MZVs). ζ(5) is a depth-1 MZV. There are many relations among MZVs over ℚ. It is conjectured that all MZVs are ℚ-linear combinations of certain "simple" zeta values (like ζ(2), ζ(3), ζ(5), ζ(7), ...). But we don't know. However, there is a result by Brown that all MZVs are ℚ-linear combinations of values ζ(m) with m odd (and maybe powers of π). But that doesn't directly help.

But perhaps we can use the theory of "motivic periods" and "Galois theory" to show that ζ(5) is irrational by showing it is not a rational number. Since ζ(5) is a period, if it were rational, it would be an "elementary period"? Not sure.

Another idea: Use analytic methods: Suppose ζ(5) = a/b rational. Then consider the function f(s) = b ζ(s) - a. This would vanish at s=5. Maybe use the functional equation to derive contradictions about zeros distribution? But ζ(s) has known zeros only on critical line (Riemann Hypothesis) but that's unknown; but we could use that ζ(s) has a simple pole at s=1, and is analytic elsewhere. But rational value at integer point doesn't give contradiction.

Maybe use the theory of "irrationality of values of the gamma function"? ζ(5) can be expressed in terms of the gamma function via the reflection formula? Not directly.

Perhaps we can use "Padé approximants" to the generating function of ζ(5). For ζ(3), Apéry used a sequence derived from Legendre polynomials. For ζ(5), one might try to use "multiple orthogonal polynomials" or "Schellhammer polynomials" to get simultaneous approximations to ζ(5) and maybe other constants. The Zudilin approach used "very-well-poised hypergeometric series" to produce linear forms in 1, ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11). That gave that at least one is irrational. To get ζ(5) alone, we might need to refine the construction to isolate it. Perhaps we can use "asymmetric" approximations that weigh ζ(5) more heavily.

Another direction: Use p-adic methods: Show that for some prime p, the p-adic valuation of an approximant sequence is bounded, leading to contradiction if ζ(5) were rational. Apéry's proof used the fact that the denominators d_n^3 are not too large and the linear forms are non-zero. For ζ(5), perhaps we can find a sequence of integers a_n, b_n such that a_n ζ(5) - b_n is non-zero and tends to zero faster than 1/(max(|a_n|,|b_n|)). That's the classic criterion for irrationality. So we need to construct such sequences. Many attempts have been made using "hypergeometric integrals with additional parameters". For example, consider the integral:

I_n = ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (x_1 ... x_5)^{α} (1 - x_1 ... x_5)^{β} P_n(x_1)...P_n(x_5) dx_1...dx_5

for suitable α, β to adjust the asymptotic. Possibly by choosing α, β we can improve the exponent. In Beukers' integrals for ζ(2) and ζ(3), the choice of P_n polynomials gave orthogonality that led to cancellation of the first few terms in the series expansion, making the integral small. For ζ(5), perhaps we need to use polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to a different weight to get better decay. For instance, use Jacobi polynomials with parameters to shift the asymptotic. Actually there is a known generalization: For ζ(2k+1), one can consider integrals of the form ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (P_n(x) ... )/(1 - x_1...x_m) with m odd? But the exponent of the denominator in the integral (the dimension) is the argument of zeta. So for ζ(5), we need a 5-dimensional integral. The smallness of the integral arises because P_n(x) approximates a delta function at the point where the denominator is singular? Actually the integral is dominated near the point (x_1,...,x_m) = (1,...,1) because denominator 1 - ∏ x_i becomes small. The Legendre polynomials P_n(x) are small near x=1? Actually P_n(x) oscillates, but its L^2 norm is something. The analysis yields the exponential decay factor (√2 - 1)^{2m n} maybe? Let's derive for general m.

Consider I_n(m) = ∫_{[0,1]^m} ∏_{i=1}^m P_n(x_i) / (1 - ∏_{i=1}^m x_i) dx_i. Expand 1/(1 - X) = ∑_{k=0}∞ X^k, with X = ∏ x_i. Then I_n(m) = ∑_{k=0}∞ ∫ ∏ P_n(x_i) (∏ x_i)^k dx_i = ∑_{k=0}∞ (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx)^m. (Note that the sum from k=0 gives term for k=0: (∫ P_n(x) dx)^m. But ∫_0^1 P_n(x) dx = 0 for n≥1? Actually ∫_0^1 P_n(x) dx = 0 for n≥1 because P_n is orthogonal to constant? Let's check: ∫_0^1 P_n(x) dx = 0 for n≥1, yes because P_0(x)=1. So the k=0 term is zero for n≥1. So sum effectively from k=1? Actually for k=0, (∏ x_i)^0 = 1, so integral = (∫ P_n(x) dx)^m = 0 for n≥1. So sum from k=1 yields ζ(m) times something? Wait ∫ P_n(x) x^k dx for k≥1 yields something. But note that the integral representation originally used ∑_{k=1}∞ (∏ x_i)^{k-1} to get ζ(m). But we can adjust index.

Standard representation: ∫_0^1 ... ∫_0^1 (dx_1 ... dx_m) / (1 - x_1 ... x_m) = ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/k^m = ζ(m). Because ∫_0^1 x_i^{k-1} dx_i = 1/k each. So we need the factor x_i^{k-1} not x_i^k. So we should define I_n(m) = ∫ ∏ P_n(x_i) / (1 - ∏ x_i) dx = ∑_{k=1}∞ ∫ ∏ P_n(x_i) (∏ x_i)^{k-1} dx = ∑_{k=1}∞ (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx)^m. That's what we used earlier.

So define a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx. Then I_n(m) = ∑_{k=1}∞ a_{n,k}^m. For m=3, we got I_n(3) ~ c λ^n. For general m, what's the asymptotic? We can attempt to approximate a_{n,k} using the integral representation derived earlier: for k > n, a_{n,k} = (-1)^n (k-1)!^2 / ((k-n-1)! (k+n)!). For k ≤ n, a_{n,k} = 0. So the sum starts at k=n+1.

Thus I_n(m) = ∑_{k=n+1}∞ [ (k-1)!^2 / ((k-n-1)! (k+n)!) ]^m (ignoring sign). We can shift j = k-n-1, then as before:

I_n(m) = ∑_{j=0}∞ [ (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!) ]^m.

Define B_{n,j} = (n+j)!^2 / (j! (2n+1+j)!). Then I_n(m) = ∑_{j=0}∞ B_{n,j}^m.

Now we can analyze B_{n,j} asymptotically for large n and j. For fixed j, B_{n,j} ~ (n!)^2 / ((2n+1)!)? Actually for j fixed, as n→∞, B_{n,j} ~ (n!)^2 / ((2n+1)!)? Not exactly because (n+j)! ~ n! n^j, (2n+1+j)! ~ (2n+1)! (2n+2)...(2n+1+j) ~ (2n+1)! (2n)^j. So B_{n,j} ~ (n!)^2 n^{2j} / ((2n+1)! (2n)^j j!) = (n!)^2 / (2n+1)! * (n^2/(2n))^j / j! = (n!)^2 / (2n+1)! * (n/2)^j / j!. The factor (n!)^2/(2n+1)! decays like C * 4^{-n} n^{-1/2} (by Stirling). So B_{n,j} ~ C * 4^{-n} n^{-1/2} * (n/2)^j / j!. For fixed j, as n large, (n/2)^j / j! grows polynomially in n. So B_{n,j} decays like 4^{-n} times polynomial. Then B_{n,j}^m decays like 4^{-m n} times polynomial. Summing over j fixed range (finite) yields overall ~ 4^{-m n}. For m=3, that's 4^{-3n} = 2^{-6n} = (1/64)^n. But actual decay for ζ(3) is about 0.029^n, which is much smaller than 4^{-3n}= (1/64)^n ≈ 0.0156^n? Actually 4^{-3n} = (1/64)^n ≈ 0.015625^n. But the observed decay for ζ(3) is about 0.029^n, which is larger (i.e., slower decay) than 0.0156^n. So the contribution from fixed j is not dominant; the dominant contribution comes from j scaling with n. Indeed, for ζ(3), the optimal scaling is j ~ n. For m=3, the sum over j yields a decay rate determined by some saddle point. So we need to analyze the sum ∑ B_{n,j}^m with j scaling with n. This is a classic problem: find asymptotic of ∑_{j} exp( m n g(j/n) ) where g(α) = f(α) from earlier. But we saw that f(α) is negative and increasing, with supremum 0 as α→∞. So the maximum of m f(α) occurs as α → ∞, but f(α) approaches 0 from below, so the supremum is 0, but not attained for any finite α. However, the sum over j includes arbitrarily large j, and as j → ∞, B_{n,j} ~ 1/j (times constant). So B_{n,j}^m ~ 1/j^m. The tail of the sum from j >> n^2 contributes on order ∑_{j>n^2} 1/j^m, which for m=5 is convergent and contributes about constant times 1/(n^2)^{m-1}? Actually ∑_{j>J} 1/j^m ~ 1/((m-1) J^{m-1}). If we take J ~ n^2, then tail contribution ~ 1/( (m-1) n^{2(m-1)} ). That's polynomial decay, not exponential. But there is also contribution from j up to n^2 where B_{n,j} is not yet ~ 1/j but may be larger? Let's examine B_{n,j} for j up to order n^2. We need to understand the behavior of B_{n,j} across the whole range.

Define j = t n^2. Then earlier we derived log B_{n,j} = -log j - (n^2 + 2n + 1)/j + ... plus maybe constant terms. More precisely, we can compute B_{n,j} asymptotically when n→∞ and j = λ n^2, with λ fixed >0. Then:

log B = -log j - (n^2)/j * (1 + O(1/n))? Actually we computed the 1/j term coefficient: -(n^2 + 2n + 1)/j. For j = λ n^2, this is -(n^2)/(λ n^2) * (1 + 2/n + 1/n^2)? Actually (n^2 + 2n + 1)/j = (n^2 + 2n + 1)/(λ n^2) = (1/λ) (1 + 2/n + 1/n^2). So log B = -log(λ n^2) - (1/λ) (1 + 2/n + 1/n^2) + lower order terms. The -log(λ n^2) = -2 log n - log λ. So log B = -2 log n - log λ - 1/λ + o(1). Thus B ~ e^{-1/λ} * 1/(λ n^2). Because exp(-2 log n) = 1/n^2, and exp(-log λ) = 1/λ. So B_{n,j} ≈ (1/λ) e^{-1/λ} * 1/n^2.

Thus B_{n,j} is of order 1/n^2 when j ∼ λ n^2. Then B^5 is of order 1/n^10. Summing over j as λ varies, the sum over j can be approximated by an integral over λ: ∑_{j} B_{n,j}^5 ≈ ∑_{j} (1/n^2)^5 * φ(λ) maybe? Actually B_{n,j}^5 ≈ (e^{-5/λ} / λ^5) * 1/n^{10}. Then the sum over j of such terms, with j = λ n^2, and Δj = 1, corresponds to Δλ = Δj / n^2 = 1/n^2. So ∑_{j} B_{n,j}^5 ≈ ∫_{0}^{∞} (e^{-5/λ} / λ^5) * (1/n^{10}) * (n^2 dλ) = (1/n^8) ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-5/λ} / λ^5 dλ. The integral converges? As λ→0+, e^{-5/λ} decays super fast, okay. As λ→∞, e^{-5/λ} → 1, integrand ~ 1/λ^5, integral converges. So I_n ∼ C / n^8. That's polynomial decay, not exponential.

But we need to check if contributions from j of order n (i.e., α finite) produce exponential terms that might dominate over polynomial? For j ~ n, B_{n,j} decays exponentially in n: B_{n,j} ≈ exp( n f(α) ) with f(α) negative. For α fixed, f(α) is some negative number; for α=1, f(1) = 2*2 log2 - 1 log1 - 3 log3? Actually compute f(1): 2(2) log2 - 1 log1 - 3 log3 = 4 log2 - 0 - 3 log3 = log(16/27) ≈ log(0.5926) = -0.523. So B_{n, n} ≈ exp(-0.523 n). Then B^5 ≈ exp(-2.615 n). That's exponential decay, much faster than polynomial 1/n^8 for large n. So the dominant contribution to the sum I_n will come from the region where B_{n,j} is largest, i.e., where the exponential factor is largest (closest to zero). Since f(α) is increasing and tends to 0 as α→∞, the largest B_{n,j} for given n occurs at the largest j? But B_{n,j} as a function of j: for small j, B is very small (exponential). As j increases, B increases, eventually transitioning from exponential decay to polynomial decay around j ~ n^2. So there will be a crossover: for j up to about n log n maybe, B is exponentially small. For j around n^2, B is polynomial ~ 1/n^2. So the maximum of B_{n,j} might be attained at j on the order of n^2, giving B_max ~ const / n^2. Then the sum of B^5 will be dominated by those j where B is of order 1/n^2, and the number of such j is O(n^2). So I_n ~ O(n^2) * (1/n^2)^5 = O(1/n^8). So indeed I_n decays polynomially like 1/n^8. Let's test with n=1: I_1 is finite ~ some constant maybe ~0.01? Actually 1/n^8 for n=1 would be 1, but I_1 is less than 1. For n=2, 1/2^8=1/256≈0.0039. I_2 maybe around that? Possibly. So seems plausible.

If I_n decays polynomially, then after multiplying by d_n^5 (which grows faster than any polynomial), the linear form d_n^5 I_n would diverge to infinity, not tend to zero. That would not give a good approximation. However, note that in Beukers' construction, the linear form is not exactly d_n^5 I_n; there are also contributions from the "B_n" part that cancels some parts to yield a combination A_n ζ(5) + B_n that is actually much smaller than I_n itself? Wait I_n itself equals A_n ζ(5) + B_n. In Beukers' method, the integral directly gives a linear form with rational coefficients. The coefficients A_n and B_n are extracted from the integral via series expansion: I_n = ∑_{k=1}∞ a_{n,k}^m = A_n ζ(m) + B_n, where A_n and B_n are rational numbers derived from the partial sums? Actually in Beukers' approach for ζ(2) and ζ(3), he writes I_n = A_n ζ(2) - B_n (or A_n ζ(3) - B_n) where A_n, B_n are integers (after multiplying by lcm). Specifically, for ζ(2), I_n = ∑_{k=1}∞ a_{n,k}^2, and he shows that a_{n,k} = something like 1/k * (some rational). Then A_n = d_n^2 * something? Actually Beukers shows that d_n^2 I_n is an integer linear combination of 1 and ζ(2) with integer coefficients, and that |d_n^2 I_n| → 0 as n→∞, proving irrationality of ζ(2). For ζ(3), d_n^3 I_n gives integer linear combination, and |d_n^3 I_n| → 0. For ζ(5), one would expect to multiply by d_n^5 to clear denominators. But if I_n decays polynomially like 1/n^8, then d_n^5 I_n ~ e^{5n} / n^8 → ∞, not zero. So that approach fails. However, maybe the denominators needed are not d_n^5 but something smaller? Perhaps the rational numbers A_n, B_n have denominators that grow slower than d_n^5; maybe they are d_n^3? Let's examine.

We need to compute A_n and B_n explicitly. For ζ(3), the integral representation yields:

I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1∫_0^1 (P_n(x)P_n(y)P_n(z))/(1-xyz) dx dy dz.

Expanding the geometric series: I_n = ∑_{k=1}∞ (∫_0^1 P_n(t) t^{k-1} dt)^3.

Now define u_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(t) t^{k-1} dt. Beukers shows that u_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{k+j}. Actually we have explicit rational expression. Then one can write:

k u_{n,k} = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{k}{k+j}.

But more importantly, u_{n,k} can be expressed as:

u_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{p_{n,k}}{q_{n,k}} where p_{n,k}, q_{n,k} are integers. Actually from the expression derived via integration by parts: for k > n, u_{n,k} = (-1)^n \frac{((k-1)!)^2}{(k-n-1)! (k+n)!}. This is rational with denominator dividing (k+n)!/(k-1)! maybe? But we can factor out something like 1/(k \binom{k+n}{n}?). Let's rewrite:

u_{n,k} = (-1)^n \frac{((k-1)!)^2}{(k-n-1)! (k+n)!} = (-1)^n \frac{(k-1)!}{(k+n)!} \frac{(k-1)!}{(k-n-1)!}.

Now note that (k+n)!/(k-1)! = (k)(k+1)...(k+n). So 1/(k+n)! * (k-1)! = 1/[(k)(k+1)...(k+n)]. So u_{n,k} = (-1)^n \frac{(k-1)!}{(k-n-1)!} * \frac{1}{(k)(k+1)...(k+n)}.

But (k-1)!/(k-n-1)! = (k-n)(k-n+1)...(k-1) if k-1 ≥ n. That's product of n terms. So u_{n,k} is rational with denominator dividing lcm(1,2,...,k+n) perhaps. But the crucial point is that when we sum over k, we can separate the sum into two parts: ∑_{k=1}^∞ u_{n,k}^3 = ∑_{k=1}^n u_{n,k}^3 + ∑_{k=n+1}^∞ u_{n,k}^3. For k ≤ n, u_{n,k} is something rational maybe zero? Actually for k ≤ n, we earlier argued u_{n,k} = 0? Let's check: For n=3, k=2, does ∫ P_3(x) x^1 dx = 0? Possibly yes, due to orthogonality? P_n is orthogonal to polynomials of degree < n. x^{k-1} is degree k-1. For k-1 < n, i.e., k ≤ n, the integral is zero. So indeed u_{n,k}=0 for k ≤ n. So the sum starts at k=n+1. Good.

Thus I_n = ∑_{k=n+1}∞ u_{n,k}^3. Now u_{n,k} for k>n is as above. Write u_{n,k} = \frac{A_{n,k}}{B_{n,k}} where A_{n,k}, B_{n,k} are integers. Then u_{n,k}^3 = A_{n,k}^3 / B_{n,k}^3. Summing over k yields a rational number whose denominator is lcm of B_{n,k}^3, but after summing we might get cancellation leading to denominator d_n^3. Beukers proves that d_n^3 I_n is integer. Actually he shows that d_n^3 u_{n,k} is integer for each k, and then the sum over k yields integer because the sum converges absolutely and the denominators are cleared uniformly. More precisely, he shows that for all integers n,k with 1 ≤ k ≤ ∞, the number d_n^3 u_{n,k} is an integer. Then ∑_{k=n+1}∞ d_n^3 u_{n,k}^3 is integer? Wait we need d_n^3 times the cube? Actually we need to consider d_n^3 u_{n,k} is integer, but we need d_n^3 * u_{n,k}^3? That would be (d_n^3 u_{n,k}) * u_{n,k}^2 / d_n^? Not integer directly. However, Beukers' approach for ζ(2) and ζ(3) uses the fact that d_n^2 u_{n,k} is integer, and then the sum ∑ u_{n,k}^2 yields something like A_n ζ(2) - B_n, and after multiplying by d_n^2, we get integer combination. Let's recall exactly:

For ζ(2), I_n = ∫∫ P_n(x)P_n(y)/(1-xy) dx dy = ∑_{k=1}∞ u_{n,k}^2. Beukers shows that d_n u_{n,k} is integer. Then d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=1}∞ (d_n u_{n,k})^2, which is sum of squares of integers, hence integer. But is that correct? Since the sum is infinite, we need to ensure convergence and that the infinite sum of integers is integer. Actually if each term is integer, the infinite sum may not be integer (could diverge or sum to something else). But the sum converges to a real number; it might not be integer. However, Beukers uses a trick: He splits the sum into two parts: ∑_{k=1}^n u_{n,k}^2 + ∑_{k=n+1}∞ u_{n,k}^2. For k ≤ n, u_{n,k} = 0, so those terms are zero. For k > n, he shows that d_n u_{n,k} is integer. Then d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=n+1}∞ (d_n u_{n,k})^2. This is an infinite sum of integers, but does it converge to an integer? Since the terms are positive integers? Actually (d_n u_{n,k})^2 is integer and positive. The sum of infinitely many positive integers would diverge to infinity unless only finitely many are non-zero. But d_n u_{n,k} for large k may not be integer? Let's check: d_n = lcm(1,2,...,n). For k > n, does d_n u_{n,k} become integer? Possibly yes. Then (d_n u_{n,k})^2 is integer. The infinite sum of positive integers cannot converge to a finite value unless all but finitely many are zero, which is not the case. So there must be a mistake. Let's revisit Beukers' proof.

Actually Beukers' proof for ζ(2) uses the integral representation and then considers the double integral. He writes I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 (P_n(x)P_n(y))/(1-xy) dx dy. Then he notes that after expanding 1/(1-xy) as ∑_{k=0}∞ (xy)^k, one gets I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx)^2. But note that the sum starts at k=0, not k=1. However, ∫_0^1 P_n(x) dx = 0 for n≥1, so the k=0 term vanishes. So I_n = ∑_{k=1}∞ a_{n,k}^2, where a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx? Actually careful: (xy)^k yields ∫ P_n(x) x^k dx. So a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx, with k starting at 0. But they shift index. In any case, similar.

Then Beukers shows that d_n a_{n,k} is integer for all k. Then d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=1}∞ (d_n a_{n,k})^2. Since d_n a_{n,k} are integers, the sum is an integer? But as argued, infinite sum of squares of integers (unless all but finitely many are zero) diverges. However, note that a_{n,k} decays rapidly as k increases, so d_n a_{n,k} might not be integer for large k; perhaps it's rational with denominator dividing something that cancels with d_n? Actually we need to examine: a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx. For k large, a_{n,k} is very small, but d_n a_{n,k} might not be integer; Beukers' claim might be that d_n a_{n,k} is integer for all k? Let's check source: In Beukers' paper "A note on the irrationality of ζ(2) and ζ(3)", he proves that d_n a_{n,k} ∈ ℤ for all n,k, where a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx. Indeed, he uses the Rodrigues formula and integration by parts to express a_{n,k} as (-1)^n / n! ∫_0^1 x^k (x(1-x))^n dx? Wait that's different: Actually he uses P_n(x) = (1/n!) d^n/dx^n (x^n (1-x)^n). Then a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx = (1/n!) ∫_0^1 x^k d^n/dx^n (x^n (1-x)^n) dx = (-1)^n / n! ∫_0^1 (d^n/dx^n x^k) x^n (1-x)^n dx. Now d^n/dx^n x^k = k(k-1)...(k-n+1) x^{k-n} if k ≥ n; if k < n, it's zero. So for k ≥ n, a_{n,k} = (-1)^n \frac{k!}{(k-n)! n!} ∫_0^1 x^{k-n} x^n (1-x)^n dx = (-1)^n \frac{k!}{(k-n)! n!} ∫_0^1 x^k (1-x)^n dx. That's Beta(k+1, n+1) = k! n! / (k+n+1)!. So a_{n,k} = (-1)^n \frac{k!}{(k-n)! n!} * \frac{k! n!}{(k+n+1)!} = (-1)^n \frac{(k!)^2}{(k-n)! (k+n+1)!}. For k < n, a_{n,k}=0.

Thus a_{n,k} = (-1)^n \frac{(k!)^2}{(k-n)! (k+n+1)!} for k ≥ n. Note the denominator (k+n+1)! and (k-n)!.

Now d_n = lcm(1,...,n). He shows that d_n a_{n,k} ∈ ℤ. Because (k!)^2/(k-n)! contains product of numbers up to k, and dividing by (k+n+1)! introduces denominator that can be cleared by d_n. Indeed, (k+n+1)! contains numbers up to k+n+1. The factor d_n clears denominators arising from the division by (k+n+1)!? Let's not get bogged.

Now d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=n}∞ (d_n a_{n,k})^2. Since each term is integer square, the infinite sum might not be integer. But Beukers argues that the sum is actually an integer because it can be expressed as ∫∫ (d_n P_n(x) d_n P_n(y))/(1-xy) dx dy, and d_n P_n(x) has integer coefficients? Wait, P_n(x) itself has integer coefficients? The shifted Legendre polynomial P_n(x) = (1/n!) d^n/dx^n (x^n (1-x)^n). The coefficients are integers? Actually the coefficients are integers because the Rodrigues formula yields integer coefficients after multiplying by n! maybe? Let's check: P_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+k}{k} (-1)^{n-k} x^k. These binomial coefficients are integers, so P_n(x) has integer coefficients. So d_n P_n(x) is also integer-coefficient polynomial, but multiplied by d_n might introduce denominators if P_n had rational coefficients, but P_n already has integer coefficients. So d_n P_n(x) is just an integer polynomial with coefficients multiplied by d_n, still integer coefficients. However, the integral I_n = ∫∫ P_n(x) P_n(y)/(1-xy) dx dy. If we multiply by d_n^2, we get ∫∫ (d_n P_n(x)) (d_n P_n(y))/(1-xy) dx dy. Since d_n P_n(x) is integer polynomial, the integrand is rational combination. But the integral of a rational function with integer polynomial numerator over [0,1]^2 might not be integer. However, Beukers uses the series expansion: d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ (d_n a_{n,k})^2. He then argues that d_n a_{n,k} are integers, and that the sum converges to an integer because it can be written as an integral of a rational function with denominator (1-xy) and numerator polynomial with integer coefficients, and the integral can be expressed as a rational number with denominator dividing something? Actually I'm not fully recalling. Let's check the actual proof: In Beukers' paper, he defines:

For ζ(2): Let P_n(x) = \frac{1}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x^n (1-x)^n). Then a_{n,k} = \int_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx. He shows that d_n a_{n,k} ∈ ℤ for all n,k. Then he considers

I_n = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{P_n(x) P_n(y)}{1-xy} dx dy = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_{n,k}^2.

Then d_n^2 I_n = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (d_n a_{n,k})^2. Since d_n a_{n,k} are integers, the right-hand side is a sum of squares of integers. However, the sum is infinite, but he argues that the sum is an integer because it's equal to the integral ∫∫ (d_n P_n(x) d_n P_n(y))/(1-xy) dx dy, and this integral can be computed as a rational number whose denominator is something like... Actually I'm mixing.

Let's look up memory: Beukers' proof that ζ(2) is irrational uses the fact that 0 < d_n^2 I_n < 2 and that d_n^2 I_n is an integer. Since it's between 0 and 2, it must be 1, leading to contradiction? Wait no, the proof for irrationality: He shows that there exist integers p_n, q_n such that |ζ(2) - p_n/q_n| < something, and that q_n ζ(2) - p_n ≠ 0. Actually the approach: He defines rational approximations a_n/b_n = (something). But let's recall the classic Apéry proof for ζ(3) uses sequences a_n, b_n with recurrence. Beukers gave a simplified proof using integrals. The structure: He defines

I_{n} = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{P_n(x) P_n(y)}{1-xy} dx dy.

Then he expands and gets I_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \left( \int_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx \right)^2? Actually I'm not sure. Let's derive: 1/(1-xy) = ∑_{k=0}^\infty (xy)^k. Then I_n = ∑_{k=0}^\infty (∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx) (∫_0^1 P_n(y) y^k dy) = ∑_{k=0}^\infty a_{n,k}^2, where a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx.

Now note that a_{n,0} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) dx = 0 for n≥1, because P_n is orthogonal to constants. So the sum starts at k=1. So I_n = ∑_{k=1}^\infty a_{n,k}^2.

Now Beukers shows that for each k, d_n a_{n,k} is integer. Then d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=1}^\infty (d_n a_{n,k})^2. Since each term is a perfect square integer, the infinite sum is an integer? Not obviously, because infinite sum of integers can be non-integer if it converges to a limit that is not integer. For example, ∑_{k=1}^\infty (1/2^k) = 1, but each term is rational not integer. But here terms are integers, but the sum of infinitely many integers can converge only if only finitely many are non-zero; otherwise the sum diverges to infinity (since positive integers). However, d_n a_{n,k} for large k might be zero? Let's check: a_{n,k} for large k decays like 1/k^2? Actually from formula a_{n,k} = (-1)^n (k!)^2 / ((k-n)! (k+n+1)!). For large k, using Stirling, a_{n,k} ~ C / k^{n+2}? Let's approximate: (k!)^2 ~ (2πk) (k/e)^{2k}. (k-n)! ~ (k/e)^{k-n} sqrt(2πk). (k+n+1)! ~ (k/e)^{k+n+1} sqrt(2πk). So ratio ~ (k/e)^{2k} / ((k/e)^{k-n} (k/e)^{k+n+1}) = (k/e)^{2k} / ((k/e)^{2k+1}) = 1/(k/e) = e/k. Actually need to be careful with factors: (k!)^2 ≈ (2πk) (k/e)^{2k}. (k-n)! ≈ (2π(k-n))^{1/2} ((k-n)/e)^{k-n} ≈ sqrt(2πk) (k/e)^{k-n} (1 - n/k)^{k-n} e^{...}. But asymptotically leading power: (k!)^2 / ((k-n)! (k+n+1)!) ~ (k^{2k} e^{-2k}) / (k^{k-n} e^{-(k-n)} * k^{k+n+1} e^{-(k+n+1)}) = k^{2k - (k-n) - (k+n+1)} e^{-2k + (k-n) + (k+n+1)} = k^{2k - 2k -1} e^{-2k + 2k +1} = k^{-1} e^{1} = e/k. So a_{n,k} ~ e * (-1)^n / k. That suggests a_{n,k} decays like 1/k, not 1/k^2. But earlier we derived for n=1, a_{1,k} = (k!)^2/( (k-1)! (k+2)! )? Actually with formula a_{n,k} = (-1)^n (k!)^2 / ((k-n)! (k+n+1)!). For n=1, a_{1,k} = (-1)^1 (k!)^2 / ((k-1)! (k+2)!) = - (k! * k) / ((k+2)!)? Let's compute: (k!)^2/(k-1)! = k! * k!/(k-1)! = k! * k. So a_{1,k} = - k! * k / (k+2)! = - k / ((k+1)(k+2)). For large k, ~ -1/k. Yes. So a_{n,k} ~ const/k. Then d_n a_{n,k} ~ d_n * const/k. Since d_n grows super-exponentially? Actually d_n ~ e^n, so d_n a_{n,k} grows like e^n/k, which for fixed k is huge, but for large k it might still be large because d_n is huge. So (d_n a_{n,k})^2 is huge, and the infinite sum ∑ (d_n a_{n,k})^2 diverges. So d_n^2 I_n would be infinite. Something is wrong: The representation d_n^2 I_n = ∑ (d_n a_{n,k})^2 cannot hold as an equality of real numbers because the right-hand side diverges. Therefore, Beukers must have used a different clearing of denominators: perhaps he used d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=1}^∞ (d_n a_{n,k}) * something else? Wait maybe he used that d_n a_{n,k} is integer, but the sum is ∑ a_{n,k}^2, so multiplying by d_n^2 yields ∑ (d_n a_{n,k})^2. But as argued, that sum diverges if d_n a_{n,k} does not tend to zero. Since d_n a_{n,k} does not tend to zero (it grows), the series diverges. So my recollection must be flawed. Let's check actual Beukers proof.

I will recall: In Beukers' paper "A note on the irrationality of ζ(2) and ζ(3)", he defines for ζ(2) the integrals:

I_{n} = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{-\log(xy)}{1-xy} P_n(x) P_n(y) dx dy

But that's for ζ(3)? Wait, there are two integrals: one for ζ(2) and one for ζ(3). Actually the integral for ζ(2) is:

I_n = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{P_n(x) P_n(y)}{1-xy} dx dy.

Then he expands 1/(1-xy) = ∑_{k=0}^\infty (xy)^k, leading to I_n = ∑_{k=0}^\infty \left( \int_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx \right)^2.

Now, he notes that for k < n, the integral is zero because P_n is orthogonal to x^k. So the sum starts at k=n. So I_n = ∑_{k=n}^\infty a_{n,k}^2, where a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx.

Then he shows that d_n a_{n,k} is integer for all k. Then d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=n}^\infty (d_n a_{n,k})^2.

Now, does this sum converge? Since a_{n,k} ~ 1/k, d_n a_{n,k} ~ d_n/k, which for large k is still large because d_n is constant with respect to k, but as k → ∞, d_n a_{n,k} ~ constant/k? Actually d_n is constant for fixed n. So d_n a_{n,k} ~ d_n * const / k. So (d_n a_{n,k})^2 ~ const / k^2. That's summable! Because a_{n,k} decays like 1/k, so d_n a_{n,k} decays like 1/k. Then its square decays like 1/k^2, which is summable. So the series converges. Good. I earlier mistakenly thought d_n a_{n,k} grows; but d_n is constant for given n, not growing with k. So as k → ∞, a_{n,k} ~ C/k, so d_n a_{n,k} ~ C d_n / k, which tends to 0. So (d_n a_{n,k})^2 ~ (C d_n)^2 / k^2, sum converges. So that's fine. So d_n^2 I_n is a finite sum of squares of rational integers? Wait d_n a_{n,k} is integer, but as k→∞, d_n a_{n,k} tends to 0, which would force it to be 0 for sufficiently large k if it's integer? But an integer that tends to 0 must eventually be 0. However, d_n a_{n,k} is integer but not necessarily zero for large k; but if it's integer and tends to 0 as k→∞, then for sufficiently large k, d_n a_{n,k} must be 0 because the only integer that can be arbitrarily close to 0 is 0 itself (since integers are discrete). Indeed, if a sequence of integers converges to 0, then it must be eventually 0. But does d_n a_{n,k} converge to 0 as k→∞? Let's check: a_{n,k} ~ (-1)^n e/k, so d_n a_{n,k} ~ d_n * e/k → 0 as k→∞. Since d_n a_{n,k} is integer, for large enough k, it must be 0. That would imply a_{n,k}=0 for large k, which is false because a_{n,k} is non-zero for all k≥n. So there is a contradiction: d_n a_{n,k} cannot be integer for all k if a_{n,k} ~ constant/k and d_n is a fixed integer. Because then d_n a_{n,k} would be rational with denominator dividing something? Let's examine: a_{n,k} = (-1)^n (k!)^2 / ((k-n)! (k+n+1)!). This is a rational number. Multiply by d_n. Since d_n contains all primes up to n, it might cancel denominators that arise from (k+n+1)! etc, but does it guarantee integer? Possibly yes, but then the resulting integer might be large for small k, but for large k, the integer could be huge? But it's integer, and as k increases, the value may not tend to 0; it might tend to infinity? Let's compute numerically for n=2. d_2 = lcm(1,2)=2. a_{2,k} = (k!)^2/((k-2)! (k+3)!). For k large, a_{2,k} ~? Using earlier formula: a_{n,k} ~ e^{n} * something? Actually for n=2, a_{2,k} ~ e^2/k^2? Let's test with k=10: compute (10!^2)/(8! * 13!) = (3628800^2)/(40320 * 6227020800) = (1.316e13)/(2.51e11) ≈ 52.5? That seems not small. Wait that's huge. Let's compute properly: 10! = 3628800. Square = 1.316e13. 8! = 40320. 13! = 6227020800. Product denominator = 40320*6227020800 ≈ 2.511e14. So a ≈ 0.0524. That's not huge. Actually 1.316e13 / 2.511e14 = 0.0524. That's about 0.05. For k=100, a_{2,100} will be even smaller maybe ~ something like 0.0005? So a_{2,k} decays like 1/k^2? Let's compute asymptotics for a_{n,k}. Using Stirling: log a = 2 log(k!) - log((k-n)!) - log((k+n+1)!). Approx: 2(k log k - k) - ((k-n) log(k-n) - (k-n)) - ((k+n+1) log(k+n+1) - (k+n+1)). For large k, expand: log(k-n) = log k + log(1 - n/k) ≈ log k - n/k - n^2/(2k^2). Similarly log(k+n+1) ≈ log k + (n+1)/k - (n+1)^2/(2k^2). Then compute:

2(k log k - k) = 2k log k - 2k.
-[(k-n)(log k - n/k - n^2/(2k^2)) - (k-n)] = -(k-n) log k + (k-n)(n/k + n^2/(2k^2)) + (k-n).
-[(k+n+1)(log k + (n+1)/k - (n+1)^2/(2k^2)) - (k+n+1)] = -(k+n+1) log k - (k+n+1)((n+1)/k - (n+1)^2/(2k^2)) + (k+n+1).

Now sum the log k terms: 2k log k - (k-n) log k - (k+n+1) log k = (2k - (k-n) - (k+n+1)) log k = (2k - k + n - k - n - 1) log k = (-1) log k. So we get -log k.

Sum the linear terms in k (without log): -2k + (k-n) + (k+n+1) = -2k + k - n + k + n + 1 = 1. So constant 1.

Now the terms from expansions: from -(k-n) log k we already accounted; the corrections from the expansions are:

From (k-n)(n/k + n^2/(2k^2)) = (k-n)n/k + (k-n)n^2/(2k^2) = n - n^2/k + (k-n)n^2/(2k^2). As k large, n - n^2/k + O(1/k). From -(k+n+1)((n+1)/k - (n+1)^2/(2k^2)) = -(k+n+1)(n+1)/k + (k+n+1)(n+1)^2/(2k^2) = -(n+1) - (n+1)^2/k + (k)(n+1)^2/(2k^2) + ... = -(n+1) - (n+1)^2/k + (n+1)^2/(2k) + ... . The constant terms: n - (n+1) = -1. Add to the constant 1 from earlier gives total constant 0. Good.

Now collect terms of order 1/k: we have from (k-n) term: - n^2/k (from n - n^2/k). Actually we need to be systematic: The constant contributions from those expansions were n and -(n+1), which sum to -1, canceling the +1 from linear terms. Next, the 1/k terms: from (k-n) expansion: - n^2/k. From -(k+n+1) expansion: - (n+1)^2/k + (n+1)^2/(2k). Also there may be contributions from the expansion of log(k-n) and log(k+n+1) in the linear terms? Actually we already accounted those expansions in the correction terms; those gave the 1/k terms we are summing. So total 1/k term = - n^2/k - (n+1)^2/k + (n+1)^2/(2k) = -( n^2 + (n+1)^2 )/k + (n+1)^2/(2k) = -( n^2 + (n+1)^2 - (n+1)^2/2 )/k = -( n^2 + (n+1)^2/2 )/k. That's O(1/k). So as k→∞, log a = -log k - ( n^2 + (n+1)^2/2 )/k + o(1/k). So a ~ e^{- ( n^2 + (n+1)^2/2 )/k } / k. For large k, e^{-c/k} ≈ 1 - c/k, so a ~ 1/k * (1 - c/k) ≈ 1/k. So indeed a_{n,k} ~ 1/k. So the leading term is 1/k, regardless of n. So d_n a_{n,k} ~ d_n/k. Since d_n is fixed integer, d_n a_{n,k} tends to 0 as k→∞, which would imply that for sufficiently large k, d_n a_{n,k} must be 0 because it's integer. But we can compute d_n a_{n,k} for large k; it's not zero. For example, n=2, d_2=2, a_{2,100} ≈ something like 0.009? Actually 2 * 0.009 = 0.018, not integer. So perhaps d_n a_{n,k} is not integer for all k; maybe it's integer only for k up to some bound? Let's check Beukers' statement: He says: "From the definition of P_n(x) we see that the numbers a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx satisfy d_n a_{n,k} ∈ ℤ for all n,k." But is that true? I recall that for ζ(3) proof, he uses the triple integral and shows that d_n^3 times something is integer. For ζ(2), he uses d_n^2 times something is integer. But maybe the statement is that d_n a_{n,k} is integer for all k? Let's test with n=1: d_1 = 1, a_{1,k} = -k/((k+1)(k+2)). That's rational but not integer generally. For k=2, a = -2/(3*4)= -2/12 = -1/6, not integer. So d_1=1 does not make it integer. So perhaps the claim is that d_n^2 a_{n,k} is integer? But then d_n^2 a_{n,k} ~ d_n^2/k, still tends to 0, forcing eventually zero. Something's off.

Let's actually look up Beukers' paper. I recall the details: For ζ(2), he defines:

A_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k}^2.

But that's Apéry's sequences. Actually Beukers gave an integral representation that simplifies Apéry's proof. The integral for ζ(2) is:

I_n = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{P_n(x) P_n(y)}{1-xy} dx dy.

He then shows that I_n = a_n ζ(2) - b_n, where a_n, b_n are integers. The integers a_n, b_n are given by:

a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k}^2? That's for ζ(3) maybe. Hmm.

Let's recall: In Apéry's proof for ζ(3), the sequences were:

a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k}^2,
b_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k}^2 \left( \sum_{m=1}^n \frac{1}{m^3} + \sum_{m=1}^k \frac{(-1)^{m-1}}{2 m^3 \binom{n}{m} \binom{n+m}{m}} \right). Something like that.

Beukers' integral for ζ(3) is:

J_n = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{P_n(x) P_n(y) P_n(z)}{1 - (1-xy)z} dx dy dz? Actually he uses a different integrand: For ζ(3), he uses

∫_0^1 ∫_0^1 ∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n z^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n (1-z)^n}{(1 - (1-xy)z)^{n+1}} dx dy dz.

That's a different representation. But in a later simplified version, he uses the Legendre polynomials directly:

I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{P_n(x) P_n(y) P_n(z)}{1 - xyz} dx dy dz.

Yes that is the version used in many expositions. Then he expands and gets:

I_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \left( \int_0^1 P_n(t) t^{k-1} dt \right)^3? Wait there is factor 1/k^3? Let's derive: 1/(1-xyz) = ∑_{k=0}∞ (xyz)^k. Then I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ (∫ P_n(x) x^k dx)^3. That's ∑ a_{n,k}^3 where a_{n,k} = ∫ P_n(x) x^k dx. But note that a_{n,0}=0, so sum from k=1. However, this representation does not have 1/k^3 factor. But then how does ζ(3) appear? Because ∫ P_n(x) x^k dx is not simply 1/k; it's something like rational combination. The connection to ζ(3) arises because when you sum a_{n,k}^3, after some manipulation you can extract ζ(3) as the leading term. Let's compute:

a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx. For large k, a_{n,k} ~ C/k. So ∑ a_{n,k}^3 converges (since 1/k^3). But where is ζ(3)? Perhaps we can express ∑ a_{n,k}^3 = A_n ζ(3) + B_n, where A_n, B_n are rational numbers. This is because a_{n,k} can be expressed as a linear combination of 1/k, 1/(k+1), ..., 1/(k+n). Indeed, from the explicit formula a_{n,k} = (-1)^n \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{k+j+1}? Let's derive from the expression a_{n,k} = (-1)^n \frac{(k!)^2}{(k-n)! (k+n+1)!}. But there is also an expression as a sum of simple fractions: using partial fractions, we can write a_{n,k} = \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{c_{n,i}}{k+i+1}. Then a_{n,k}^3 leads to sums of the form ∑_{k} 1/(k+α)^3, which give ζ(3) plus rational combination of 1/α^2 etc. Actually, the sum ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/(k+α)^3 = ζ(3) - ∑_{m=1}^{α} 1/m^3? Not exactly. But we can express ∑_{k=0}∞ 1/(k+α)^3 = ψ''(α)/2 etc. However, it's plausible that ∑ a_{n,k}^3 yields a rational linear combination of 1 and ζ(3). Indeed, Beukers shows that I_n = A_n ζ(3) - B_n, with A_n, B_n integers.

Let's verify: I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ a_{n,k}^3. Write a_{n,k} = ∑_{j=0}^n \frac{α_{n,j}}{k+j+1}. Then a_{n,k}^3 expands into sums of terms like 1/[(k+i+1)(k+j+1)(k+l+1)]. Summing over k from 0 to ∞ yields combinations of ζ(3) and rational numbers. The coefficients A_n arise from the sum of terms where the three indices are equal? Actually the leading term that yields ζ(3) comes from the diagonal part where i=j=l, because ∑_{k} 1/(k+i+1)^3 = ζ(3) - ∑_{m=1}^{i+1} 1/m^3? Wait we need to be careful: ∑_{k=0}∞ 1/(k+α)^3 = ζ(3, α) is the Hurwitz zeta, which is ζ(3) plus rational combination of 1/α^2 etc? Not exactly; Hurwitz zeta ζ(s, α) = ∑_{n=0}∞ 1/(n+α)^s, for α>0. It has an expansion in terms of Bernoulli polynomials, but is not simply ζ(s) plus rational. However, when α is rational, ζ(s, α) is a linear combination of polylogarithms evaluated at roots of unity, which are not generally rational combinations of ζ(s). But maybe because we sum over k from 1 to ∞ with shift? Actually we can rewrite ∑_{k=0}∞ 1/(k+α)^3 = ∑_{m=α}^{\infty} 1/m^3 where m runs over numbers starting at α, not integers. That's not directly ζ(3). So I'm not convinced.

Let's check Beukers' actual derivation. I'll recall from memory: For ζ(2), he uses the integral I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 P_n(x)P_n(y)/(1-xy) dx dy. Then he writes:

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ a_{n,k}^2, with a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx.

He then notes that a_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k+1} \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{k+j+1}? Actually there is known identity: ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx = \frac{1}{k+1} \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{k+j+1}. Let's derive from the series representation: P_n(x) = ∑_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} x^j. Then ∫_0^1 x^{j+k} dx = 1/(j+k+1). So a_{n,k} = ∑_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{j+k+1}. That's a single sum, not double. So a_{n,k} is a rational linear combination of 1/(k+1), 1/(k+2), ..., 1/(k+n+1). Indeed, as j varies, denominator is j+k+1, which ranges from k+1 to k+n+1. So a_{n,k} = ∑_{i=k+1}^{k+n+1} c_{n,i} / i, where c are integers (after clearing denominators). That's a key property: a_{n,k} is a rational linear combination of 1/(k+1),...,1/(k+n+1) with integer coefficients (up to a factor). Then a_{n,k}^2 expands into sums of 1/(i j) etc. Summing over k yields combinations of sums like ∑_{k=0}∞ 1/[(k+α)(k+β)], which can be expressed as (ψ(α)-ψ(β))/(α-β). Those give rational combinations of logarithms? Actually ψ is digamma, which yields rational combinations of logarithms and maybe γ. For ζ(2), the sum ∑ 1/(k+α)^2 gives ψ'(α), which for rational α is π^2 times something? Actually ψ'(α) is related to π^2 and rational numbers? There is known identity: ψ'(p/q) = π^2 csc^2(π p/q) - something? Not rational. Hmm.

But Beukers' proof for ζ(2) uses a different integral: ∫_0^1∫_0^1 (P_n(x) P_n(y))/(1-xy) dx dy = A_n ζ(2) + B_n, with A_n, B_n integers. He shows that A_n = denominator something. How does ζ(2) emerge? Because the sum ∑ a_{n,k}^2 can be expressed as ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/k^2 times something? Let's derive:

a_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^k dx. But also we have representation: a_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k+1} \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{k+j+1}. This is messy.

Alternatively, there is a known expression: a_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k+1} \frac{Q_n(k)}{R_n(k)} where Q_n, R_n are integer polynomials. But the sum ∑ a_{n,k}^2 may not directly give ζ(2). However, Beukers uses a clever trick: He writes:

I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{P_n(x) P_n(y)}{1-xy} dx dy = \int_0^1\int_0^1 P_n(x) P_n(y) \sum_{k=1}^\infty (xy)^{k-1} dx dy = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left( \int_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx \right)^2.

Now define u_{n,k} = ∫_0^1 P_n(x) x^{k-1} dx. Then I_n = ∑_{k=1}^\infty u_{n,k}^2. But u_{n,k} can be expressed as:

u_{n,k} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{k+j}. Actually using the series expansion: P_n(x) = ∑_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} x^j. Then ∫_0^1 x^{j+k-1} dx = 1/(j+k). So u_{n,k} = ∑_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} \binom{n+j}{j} \frac{1}{j+k}. This is similar to a_{n,k} but with shift. So u_{n,k} is a rational linear combination of 1/k, 1/(k+1), ..., 1/(k+n). So we can write:

u_{n,k} = \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{A_{n,i}}{k+i}, where A_{n,i} are integers (after multiplying by something). Actually we can clear denominator: let L_n = lcm(1,2,...,n). Then L_n u_{n,k} is integer? Possibly yes. Let's test with n=1: P_1(x)=1-2x. u_{1,k} = ∫_0^1 (1-2x) x^{k-1} dx = 1/k - 2/(k+1). This is a combination of 1/k and 1/(k+1). The coefficients are integers (1 and -2). So L_1=1, L_1 u_{1,k} = u_{1,k} is not integer generally, e.g., k=2: 1/2 - 2/3 = -1/6, not integer. So L_n u_{n,k} not integer. But maybe d_n^2 u_{n,k} is integer? Let's compute d_1=1, d_1^2=1, still not integer. So maybe we need to multiply by d_n^2? Let's test n=2: P_2(x)=1-6x+6x^2. u_{2,k} = 1/k - 6/(k+1) + 6/(k+2). For k=3: 1/3 - 6/4 + 6/5 = 0.333 - 1.5 + 1.2 = 0.03333... = 1/30? Actually 1/3 = 10/30, -6/4 = -90/30? Wait 6/4 = 3/2 = 45/30, 6/5 = 36/30. So sum = (10 - 45 + 36)/30 = 1/30. So u_{2,3}=1/30. That's rational with denominator 30. d_2=2, d_2^2=4, 4/30 = 2/15 not integer. So not that.

But Beukers' proof does not claim that d_n u_{n,k} is integer; rather, he claims that d_n^2 I_n is integer. That is because the integral representation yields an expression that after expanding yields a sum of fractions that combine to an integer. He shows that d_n^2 I_n = ∑_{k=1}∞ (d_n u_{n,k})^2, and then argues that each term (d_n u_{n,k})^2 is integer? But that would require d_n u_{n,k} integer, which is false as seen. So maybe he uses d_n = lcm(1,...,n) and then shows that d_n^2 I_n is integer by a different argument, not by termwise integrality. Actually he might argue that d_n P_n(x) has integer coefficients, and that the double integral of (d_n P_n(x) d_n P_n(y))/(1-xy) can be expressed as a rational number with denominator dividing something like... Hmm.

Let's check a reliable source: I recall that in Beukers' proof for ζ(2), he defines:

I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy.

But that's a different integral. Actually that's the one used for ζ(3)? Let's recall: Beukers (1979) gave two integrals:

For ζ(2): I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy.

For ζ(3): J_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n z^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n (1-z)^n}{(1 - (1-xy)z)^{n+1}} dx dy dz.

Yes! That's the original Beukers integrals. The Legendre polynomial version came later as a simplification. In those integrals, the numerator involves x^n(1-x)^n, which is like the function used to define Legendre polynomials: P_n(x) is essentially (1/n!) d^n/dx^n (x^n(1-x)^n). But the integral directly uses the monomials. Let's recall: For ζ(2), Beukers considered

I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy.

He then expanded (1-xy)^{-n-1} as a binomial series:

(1-xy)^{-n-1} = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} (xy)^k.

Then I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} ∫_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx ∫_0^1 y^{n+k} (1-y)^n dy.

Each inner integral is a Beta integral: ∫_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx = \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!}. So

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^2.

Simplify: \binom{n+k}{k} = \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!}. So

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^2 = ∑_{k=0}∞ \frac{((n+k)!)^3 n!}{k! ((2n+k+1)!)^2}.

This is messy but yields rational approximations to ζ(2). Actually he shows that I_n = A_n ζ(2) + B_n, where A_n, B_n are integers and I_n → 0. The denominators are controlled by d_n^2. This is the classic proof.

So the Legendre polynomial version is a later simplification that might be more transparent but essentially equivalent.

Given this, we can try to generalize Beukers' integral to ζ(5). The natural generalization would be:

I_n = ∫_{[0,1]^5} \frac{ \prod_{i=1}^5 x_i^n (1-x_i)^n }{ (1 - x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5)^{n+1} } dx_1 ... dx_5.

Expand the denominator: (1 - X)^{-n-1} = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} X^k, where X = ∏ x_i.

Then I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} ∏_{i=1}^5 ∫_0^1 x_i^{n+k} (1-x_i)^n dx_i.

Each integral is Beta(n+k+1, n+1) = \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!}. So the product over i gives [ (n+k)! n! / (2n+k+1)! ]^5. Thus

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^5.

Simplify: \binom{n+k}{k} = \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!}. So

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^5 = ∑_{k=0}∞ \frac{((n+k)!)^6 n!^4}{k! ((2n+k+1)!)^5}.

Now we can factor out something like (n!)^? Actually we can write:

I_n = \frac{n!^4}{?} ∑_{k=0}∞ \frac{((n+k)!)^6}{k! ((2n+k+1)!)^5}.

But more importantly, we can attempt to analyze the asymptotic of I_n as n → ∞. For ζ(2), I_n decays like C (√5-1)/2? Actually for ζ(2), I_n ~ C λ^n with λ = (√5-1)/2? Something like that. Let's recall: For ζ(2), Beukers' integral yields I_n = O( (√5-1)^{2n} )? I'm not sure. But the irrationality proof for ζ(2) used that I_n ~ (√5-1)^{4n}? No, that's for ζ(3). For ζ(2), the irrationality is already known via π^2/6, but they still gave a proof. Actually Apéry proved ζ(2) irrational using similar methods, but it's already known to be irrational because π is transcendental. But the Apéry-style proof gave a new proof. For ζ(2), the approximations gave error ~ (√5-1)^{2n} maybe.

We need to analyze I_n for m=5. Possibly the asymptotic is something like I_n ~ C n^{-α} for some α, not exponential. That would be problematic. Let's test with small n numeric to guess. For n=1, I_1 = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{1+k}{k} [ (1+k)! * 1! / (2+1+k)! ]^5? Wait compute: n=1, (n+k)! = (1+k)!, n! = 1, (2n+k+1)! = (3+k)!. So term = \binom{1+k}{k} * [ (1+k)! / (3+k)! ]^5. \binom{1+k}{k} = 1+k. (1+k)!/(3+k)! = 1/[(k+2)(k+3)]. Because (3+k)! = (k+3)! = (k+3)(k+2)(k+1)!. So (1+k)!/(k+3)! = 1/[(k+2)(k+3)]. So term = (k+1) / [ (k+2)^5 (k+3)^5 ]. Sum from k=0 to ∞. That sum converges and is some constant. For n=2, term more complicated but still yields constant. So as n increases, I_n seems to converge to 0? Let's test n=2: n=2, (n+k)! = (2+k)!, n! = 2, (2n+k+1)! = (5+k)!. So term = \binom{2+k}{k} * [ (2+k)! * 2 / (5+k)! ]^5. Compute (2+k)!/(5+k)! = 1/[(k+3)(k+4)(k+5)]. So term = \binom{2+k}{k} * [ 2 / ((k+3)(k+4)(k+5)) ]^5. \binom{2+k}{k} = (k+2)(k+1)/2. So term = ((k+2)(k+1)/2) * 32 / ((k+3)^5 (k+4)^5 (k+5)^5) = 16 (k+2)(k+1) / ((k+3)^5 (k+4)^5 (k+5)^5). This decays like 1/k^{13}? Actually (k+2)(k+1) ~ k^2, denominator ~ k^{15}, so term ~ 1/k^{13}. Sum converges. As n increases, the power of decay in k may increase, making the sum smaller. But does I_n tend to 0 as n→∞? Possibly yes, but at what rate? We can attempt to find leading term asymptotics.

Define term T_{n,k} = \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^5.

We can write:

T_{n,k} = \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^5 = \frac{((n+k)!)^6 n!^4}{k! ((2n+k+1)!)^5}.

Now, for large n, the dominant contribution to the sum over k may come from k scaling like n^2? Let's analyze asymptotics similarly to before. Define j = k. We can use Stirling approximations for large n and k. But we need to find the scaling that maximizes T_{n,k}. Since T_{n,k} is positive, we can examine its logarithm:

log T = 6 log (n+k)! + 4 log n! - log k! - 5 log (2n+k+1)!.

Set n large. Consider different regimes: k fixed, k ~ n, k ~ n^2, etc.

Case 1: k fixed. Then (n+k)! ~ n! n^k, (2n+k+1)! ~ (2n)! (2n)^{k+1}? Actually (2n+k+1)! ≈ (2n)! * (2n+1)...(2n+k+1) ~ (2n)! (2n)^{k+1}. So log T ≈ 6( log n! + k log n ) + 4 log n! - log k! - 5( log (2n)! + (k+1) log (2n) ). Using Stirling: log n! ~ n log n - n, log (2n)! ~ 2n log (2n) - 2n. So:

log T ≈ (6+4) log n! - 5 log (2n)! + 6k log n - 5(k+1) log (2n) - log k! + O(1). = 10 log n! - 5 log (2n)! + 6k log n - 5k log (2n) - 5 log (2n) - log k!.

Now 10 log n! - 5 log (2n)! ≈ 10 (n log n - n) - 5 (2n log (2n) - 2n) = 10 n log n - 10 n - 10 n log (2n) + 10 n = 10 n (log n - log (2n)) = -10 n log 2. So leading term is -10 n log 2, which is linear in n, negative large. So T ~ exp(-10 n log 2) = 2^{-10n}. That's exponentially small.

Case 2: k = α n, with α fixed >0. Then we can use scaling: n+k = n(1+α), 2n+k+1 ≈ n(2+α). Then as before, we can compute leading term: log T ≈ n g(α) + O(log n), where g(α) = 6[(1+α) log(1+α) - (1+α)] + 4[1 log 1 - 1]? Actually we need to apply Stirling to each term:

log T = 6 log((n+k)!) + 4 log(n!) - log(k!) - 5 log((2n+k+1)!).

Write:

log((n+k)!) = (n+k) log(n+k) - (n+k) + 1/2 log(2π (n+k)) + ...
log(n!) = n log n - n + 1/2 log(2π n) + ...
log(k!) = k log k - k + 1/2 log(2π k) + ...
log((2n+k+1)!) = (2n+k+1) log(2n+k+1) - (2n+k+1) + 1/2 log(2π (2n+k+1)) + ...

Plug in n large, k = α n. Then n+k = n(1+α), k = α n, 2n+k+1 = n(2+α) + 1 ≈ n(2+α). Then we can compute the leading n term:

6[(n+k) log(n+k) - (n+k)] + 4[n log n - n] - [k log k - k] - 5[(2n+k+1) log(2n+k+1) - (2n+k+1)].

Combine the linear - terms: -6(n+k) -4n + k +5(2n+k+1) = -6n -6k -4n + k +10n +5k +5 = ( -6n -4n +10n ) + (-6k + k +5k) +5 = 0n + 0k +5 = 5.

But we also have constant 5 from the +5 after expansion? Actually careful: The expression includes +5 from the linear combination: 6[ - (n+k) ] + 4[ - n ] - [ - k ] -5[ - (2n+k+1) ] = -6(n+k) -4n + k +5(2n+k+1) = -6n -6k -4n + k +10n +5k +5 = ( -6n -4n +10n ) + (-6k + k +5k) +5 = 0n + 0k +5. So constant +5.

Now the log terms: 6 (n+k) log(n+k) + 4 n log n - k log k - 5 (2n+k+1) log(2n+k+1). Let's approximate with k = α n.

6 (n(1+α)) log(n(1+α)) = 6 n(1+α) (log n + log(1+α)).
4 n log n.
- k log k = - α n (log n + log α).
-5 (2n+k+1) log(2n+k+1) ≈ -5 n(2+α) (log n + log(2+α)).

Now sum the coefficients of n log n: 6(1+α) + 4 - α - 5(2+α) = 6 + 6α + 4 - α - 10 - 5α = (6+4-10) + (6α - α - 5α) = 0 + 0 = 0. So cancellation occurs. Good.

Thus the leading term is n times combination of logs without n factor:

n [ 6(1+α) log(1+α) + 4*0? Actually the 4 n log n contributed only to n log n cancellation; we need to include the constant terms from the logs: 4 n log n gave 4 log n term, but its contribution to the n factor is 4 log n, which we combined with others to cancel n log n. The remaining n-dependent term is n times:

6(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - 5(2+α) log(2+α). Plus also 4? Wait 4 n log n contributed 4 log n, which is part of the n log n cancellation. After cancellation, the remaining term from 4 n log n is 0 in the n * something expression, but there may be a constant term from the expansion of 4 n log n? Actually we should treat as: 4 n log n = 4 n (log n). When we factor n, we get 4 log n, which is not of the form n * f(α) because log n is not a function of α. But we can rewrite log n = log( (n+k)/ (1+α) )? That seems messy. Better approach: Use the scaling method with variables: set n large, k = α n. Then we can approximate directly using Stirling's formula for each factorial without separating the n log n term individually; we can compute log T as:

log T = 6[ (n+k) log(n+k) - (n+k) ] + 4[ n log n - n ] - [ k log k - k ] - 5[ (2n+k+1) log(2n+k+1) - (2n+k+1) ] + lower order.

Now plug in n+k = n(1+α), k = α n, 2n+k+1 ≈ n(2+α). Then:

6 term: 6 n(1+α) [ log n + log(1+α) ] - 6 n(1+α).
4 term: 4 n log n - 4 n.
- term: - α n [ log n + log α ] + α n.
-5 term: -5 n(2+α) [ log n + log(2+α) ] + 5 n(2+α).

Now sum:

Coefficient of n log n: 6(1+α) + 4 - α - 5(2+α) = as before 0.
Coefficient of n (without log): from the logs: 6 n(1+α) log(1+α) - α n log α - 5 n(2+α) log(2+α). Then the linear terms: -6 n(1+α) - 4 n + α n + 5 n(2+α) = n[ -6(1+α) -4 + α + 5(2+α) ] = n[ -6 -6α -4 + α + 10 +5α ] = n[0] = 0. Good. So all n-dependent terms are captured in the log(1+α), log α, log(2+α) terms.

Thus log T ≈ n [ 6(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - 5(2+α) log(2+α) ] + constant terms (like +5 from earlier? Wait we have constant +5 from the +5 in the linear combination? Actually we derived earlier that after summing the - (n+k) etc there is a constant +5. Let's re-evaluate: In the expression for log T, after using Stirling, we have the main terms as above plus the constant +5? Let's check: The Stirling expansion for each factorial includes a term + 1/2 log(2π m). We'll handle those later. The linear terms we accounted: 6[ - (n+k) ] + 4[ - n ] - [ - k ] -5[ - (2n+k+1) ] = -6(n+k) -4n + k +5(2n+k+1). Compute that: -6n -6k -4n + k +10n +5k +5 = ( -6n -4n +10n ) + (-6k + k +5k) +5 = 0n + 0k +5. So there is a constant +5 from the linear - terms. This constant is independent of n and α. So we must add +5 to log T.

Also we have the 1/2 log(2π m) terms: 6*(1/2) log(2π (n+k)) + 4*(1/2) log(2π n) - (1/2) log(2π k) - 5*(1/2) log(2π (2n+k+1)). That's (1/2)[6 log(2π (n+k)) + 4 log(2π n) - log(2π k) - 5 log(2π (2n+k+1))] = (1/2)[6 log(n+k) + 4 log n - log k - 5 log(2n+k+1) + (6+4-1-5) log(2π) ] = (1/2)[6 log(n+k) + 4 log n - log k - 5 log(2n+k+1) + 4 log(2π) ].

These contribute O(log n). They may affect the constant term but not the exponential rate.

Thus log T ≈ n f_5(α) + 5 + O(log n), where

f_5(α) = 6(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - 5(2+α) log(2+α).

We can analyze f_5(α) to see its maximum. As α → 0+, we need limit. For α → 0, 6(1+α) log(1+α) → 0, -α log α → 0, -5(2+α) log(2+α) → -5 * 2 log 2 = -10 log 2. So f_5(0) = -10 log 2 ≈ -6.9315.

As α → ∞, we can expand: For large α, use expansions:

6(1+α) log(1+α) = 6α (1 + 1/α) log(α(1+1/α)) ≈ 6α (log α + 1/α) (1 + 1/α?) Actually better: (1+α) log(1+α) = α (1+1/α) (log α + log(1+1/α)) = α (1+1/α) (log α + 1/α - 1/(2α^2) + ...) = α log α + α*(1/α) + log α + (1/α)*... Let's compute: (1+α) log(1+α) = α log α + α * (1/α) + log α + O(1/α). More precisely, expand: log(1+α) = log α + log(1+1/α) = log α + 1/α - 1/(2α^2) + 1/(3α^3) - ... Multiply by (1+α) = α + 1:

(α+1)(log α + 1/α - 1/(2α^2) + 1/(3α^3) - ...) = α log α + α*(1/α) + α*(-1/(2α^2)) + α*(1/(3α^3)) + ... + 1*log α + 1*(1/α) + 1*(-1/(2α^2)) + ... = α log α + 1 - 1/(2α) + 1/(3α^2) + ... + log α + 1/α - 1/(2α^2) + ....

Thus (1+α) log(1+α) = α log α + log α + 1 + (1/α) * ( -1/2 + 1 )? Actually the 1/α term: from α * (-1/(2α^2)) gives -1/(2α), from 1*(1/α) gives +1/α, sum = +1/(2α). So we have +1/(2α) + higher. So for large α, (1+α) log(1+α) = α log α + log α + 1 + O(1/α).

Similarly, (2+α) log(2+α) = α log α + log α + 2 + O(1/α). Because (2+α) log(2+α) = α log α + log α + 2 + O(1/α). Let's derive quickly: Write (α+2) log(α+2) = α (1+2/α) [log α + log(1+2/α)] = α (log α + 2/α - 2/α^2 + ... ) + 2 (log α + 2/α - 2/α^2 + ... ) = α log α + 2 + O(1/α) + 2 log α + O(1/α). So α log α + 2 log α + 2 + O(1/α). Actually we need to be consistent: The leading term is α log α, then next is 2 log α? Let's compute: α * log α + α*(2/α) = α log α + 2. Then α * (-2/α^2) = -2/α, etc. Then +2 log α + 2*(2/α) = 2 log α + 4/α. So sum = α log α + 2 log α + 2 + ( -2/α + 4/α ) + ... = α log α + 2 log α + 2 + 2/α + ... So indeed (2+α) log(2+α) = α log α + 2 log α + 2 + O(1/α). Good.

Now compute f_5(α) = 6(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - 5(2+α) log(2+α).

Plug expansions:

6(1+α) log(1+α) = 6[ α log α + log α + 1 + O(1/α) ] = 6α log α + 6 log α + 6 + O(1/α).
- α log α stays.
-5(2+α) log(2+α) = -5[ α log α + 2 log α + 2 + O(1/α) ] = -5α log α - 10 log α - 10 + O(1/α).

Sum: (6α log α - α log α - 5α log α) + (6 log α - 10 log α) + (6 - 10) + O(1/α) = (0α log α) + (-4 log α) + (-4) + O(1/α). So f_5(α) ≈ -4 log α - 4 + O(1/α). As α → ∞, log α → ∞, so f_5(α) → -∞. That's interesting: For large α, f_5(α) becomes negative large, not approaching 0. So the maximum of f_5(α) may be at some finite α where derivative zero, not at infinity. Because as α → ∞, f_5(α) → -∞, as α→0, f_5(0) = -10 log 2 ≈ -6.93. So there is a maximum at some α where f_5'(α)=0. Let's compute f_5'(α).

f_5(α) = 6(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - 5(2+α) log(2+α).

Derivative: f_5'(α) = 6[ log(1+α) + (1+α)*(1/(1+α)) ] - [ log α + α*(1/α) ] - 5[ log(2+α) + (2+α)*(1/(2+α)) ] = 6[ log(1+α) + 1 ] - [ log α + 1 ] - 5[ log(2+α) + 1 ] = 6 log(1+α) + 6 - log α - 1 - 5 log(2+α) - 5 = 6 log(1+α) - log α - 5 log(2+α) + (6 - 1 - 5) = 6 log(1+α) - log α - 5 log(2+α).

So f_5'(α) = 6 log(1+α) - log α - 5 log(2+α). Set to zero:

6 log(1+α) = log α + 5 log(2+α) => log( (1+α)^6 ) = log( α (2+α)^5 ) => (1+α)^6 = α (2+α)^5.

This is an algebraic equation. We can attempt to solve for α. Let's denote α > 0. This equation may have a unique positive solution. We can attempt to find approximate numeric solution. Let's define φ(α) = (1+α)^6 / (α (2+α)^5). Set equal to 1. Compute for α=1: (2)^6=64, denominator 1*(3)^5=243, ratio ≈ 0.263. Less than 1. α=2: (3)^6=729, denominator 2*(4)^5=2*1024=2048, ratio≈0.356. α=3: (4)^6=4096, denominator 3*(5)^5=3*3125=9375, ratio≈0.437. α=4: (5)^6=15625, denominator 4*(6)^5=4*7776=31104, ratio≈0.502. α=5: (6)^6=46656, denominator 5*(7)^5=5*16807=84035, ratio≈0.555. α=6: (7)^6=117649, denominator 6*(8)^5=6*32768=196608, ratio≈0.598. α=7: (8)^6=262144, denominator 7*(9)^5=7*59049=413343, ratio≈0.634. α=8: (9)^6=531441, denominator 8*(10)^5=8*100000=800000, ratio≈0.664. α=9: (10)^6=1e6, denominator 9*(11)^5=9*161051=1.449e6, ratio≈0.690. α=10: (11)^6=1771561, denominator 10*(12)^5=10*248832=2.488e6, ratio≈0.712. So ratio is increasing but still below 1 at α=10. α=20: (21)^6 ≈ 85,766,121? Actually 21^6 = 85766121? Let's compute: 21^2=441, ^3=9261, ^4=194481, ^5=4084101, ^6=85766121. Denominator: α=20, (2+α)=22, 22^5=5153632? Actually 22^5 = 5153632? Let's compute: 22^2=484, ^3=10648, ^4=234256, ^5=5153632. Times α=20 gives 103072640. Ratio ≈ 0.832. α=50: (51)^6? 51^6 is huge. Let's compute ratio roughly: (1+α)^6 ≈ α^6 (1 + 1/α)^6 ≈ α^6 (1 + 6/α + ...). Denominator α (2+α)^5 ≈ α * α^5 (1 + 2/α)^5 = α^6 (1 + 2/α)^5 ≈ α^6 (1 + 10/α + ...). So ratio ≈ (1 + 6/α) / (1 + 10/α) ≈ 1 - 4/α + ... So as α→∞, ratio → 1 from below. So there is a unique α where ratio=1, i.e., f_5'(α)=0, and that α is fairly large. As α→∞, ratio approaches 1 from below, so the equation (1+α)^6 = α (2+α)^5 is asymptotically equivalent to α^6 (1+6/α) ≈ α^6 (1+10/α) => 1+6/α ≈ 1+10/α => 6≈10, impossible. So the equation cannot hold for arbitrarily large α; the ratio tends to 1, but it might cross 1 at some finite α? Let's examine limit: As α→∞, ratio = (1+α)^6 / (α (2+α)^5) = (α(1+1/α))^6 / (α * (α(1+2/α))^5) = α^6 (1+1/α)^6 / (α * α^5 (1+2/α)^5) = (1+1/α)^6 / (1+2/α)^5. As α→∞, numerator → 1, denominator → 1, so ratio → 1. So the ratio approaches 1 from below? We need to see if it's always less than 1 or can exceed 1. Compute ratio for large α: (1+1/α)^6 = 1 + 6/α + 15/α^2 + ...; (1+2/α)^5 = 1 + 10/α + 40/α^2 + ... So ratio = (1 + 6/α + 15/α^2 + ...) / (1 + 10/α + 40/α^2 + ...) = 1 - 4/α + O(1/α^2). So ratio < 1 for large α. So ratio approaches 1 from below. At α=0+, ratio? As α→0+, (1+α)^6 → 1, denominator α (2+α)^5 ~ α * 2^5 = 32α → 0, so ratio → ∞. So ratio starts very large near α=0 (since denominator small), then decreases, crosses 1 at some α where f_5'(α)=0. Since at α=1 ratio≈0.263<1, already below 1. Wait at α=0+, ratio→∞, but at α=1 ratio≈0.263, so it must cross 1 somewhere between 0 and 1. Let's test α=0.1: (1.1)^6 = 1.771561; denominator 0.1*(2.1)^5. (2.1)^5 =? 2.1^2=4.41, ^3=9.261, ^4=19.4481, ^5≈40.84101. Times 0.1 = 4.084101. Ratio≈1.771561/4.084101≈0.434. That's <1. So ratio is already <1 at α=0.1. That suggests that ratio might be >1 only for extremely small α, maybe α < 0.05? Let's test α=0.01: (1.01)^6 ≈ 1.0615; denominator 0.01*(2.01)^5. (2.01)^5: 2.01^2=4.0401, ^3≈8.120601, ^4≈16.322, ^5≈32.808. Times 0.01 = 0.32808. Ratio≈3.236. >1. So there is a root around α≈0.02 maybe. So f_5'(α)=0 at some small α. That gives a critical point. Since f_5(α) at α small is negative large? Actually f_5(0) = -10 log 2 ≈ -6.93. At α small positive, f_5(α) maybe increases? Let's compute f_5(α) near α=0 using expansion: For small α, (1+α) log(1+α) = α - α^2/2 + α^3/3 - ... Actually log(1+α)=α - α^2/2 + α^3/3 - α^4/4 + ... Multiply by (1+α): (1+α)*(α - α^2/2 + α^3/3 - α^4/4 + ...) = α + α^2 - α^2/2 - α^3/2 + α^3/3 + α^4/3 - α^4/4 - ... = α + α^2/2 - α^3/6 + α^4/12 - ... (We need to compute up to order α^2 maybe). Let's do systematically: (1+α) log(1+α) = (1+α)(α - α^2/2 + α^3/3 - α^4/4 + α^5/5 - ...) = α - α^2/2 + α^3/3 - α^4/4 + α^5/5 - ... + α^2 - α^3/2 + α^4/3 - α^5/4 + ... = α + ( -1/2 + 1 )α^2 + ( 1/3 - 1/2 )α^3 + ( -1/4 + 1/3 )α^4 + ( 1/5 - 1/4 )α^5 + ... = α + (1/2)α^2 + (-1/6)α^3 + (1/12)α^4 + (-1/20)α^5 + ... .

Similarly, α log α is not analytic at 0, but we consider α small positive, α log α → 0 (since α log α → 0). But its derivative blows up. However, f_5(α) includes -α log α, which for small α is positive (since -α log α > 0). So f_5(α) may increase from -10 log 2 at α=0 to some higher value as α increases a bit. Let's compute f_5(α) for α=0.1: using exact? We can approximate numerically: 6(1.1)log(1.1) = 6*1.1*0.09531=6*0.10484=0.6290. α log α = 0.1*log(0.1)=0.1*(-2.302585)= -0.2302585, so -α log α = +0.2302585? Wait f_5 has - α log α, so that term contributes -α log α = - (0.1 * -2.3026) = +0.23026. Actually -α log α = - (0.1 * -2.3026) = +0.23026. But careful: α log α is negative, so -α log α is positive. Next, 5(2+α) log(2+α) = 5*2.1*log(2.1)=5*2.1*0.741937=5*1.55807=7.79035. So f_5 = 0.6290 + 0.2303 - 7.7904 = -6.9311. That's about -10 log 2 ≈ -6.9315. So f_5(0.1) is almost same as f_5(0). So it's not increasing much. Let's test α=0.5: 6(1.5)log(1.5)=6*1.5*0.405465=6*0.60820=3.6492. α log α = 0.5*log0.5=0.5*(-0.693147)=-0.34657, so -α log α = +0.34657. 5(2.5)log(2.5)=5*2.5*0.916291=5*2.29073=11.4536. Sum: 3.6492+0.3466-11.4536=-7.4578. That's lower (more negative). So f_5 decreases after a small increase maybe. Let's test α=0.01: 6(1.01)log(1.01)=6*1.01*0.00995033=6*0.0100498=0.060299. α log α = 0.01*log0.01=0.01*(-4.60517)=-0.0460517, -α log α = +0.0460517. 5(2.01)log(2.01)=5*2.01*0.698135=5*1.40325=7.01627. Sum = 0.0603+0.04605-7.01627 = -6.90992. Slightly higher than -6.9315. So f_5(0.01) ≈ -6.91, which is greater than f_5(0) = -6.9315. So there is a slight maximum at some small α, maybe around α≈0.02? Let's compute α=0.02: 6(1.02)log(1.02)=6*1.02*0.0198026=6*0.0201987=0.121192. α log α = 0.02*log(0.02)=0.02*(-3.91202)=-0.0782404, -α log α=+0.0782404. 5(2.02)log(2.02)=5*2.02*0.703098=5*1.42026=7.1013. Sum=0.12119+0.07824-7.1013=-6.9019. Slightly higher. α=0.03: 6(1.03)log(1.03)=6*1.03*0.0295588=6*0.030445=0.18267. α log α = 0.03*log(0.03)=0.03*(-3.506557)=-0.1051967, -α log α=+0.10520. 5(2.03)log(2.03)=5*2.03*0.707332=5*1.43588=7.1794. Sum=0.1827+0.1052-7.1794=-6.8915. α=0.04: 6(1.04)log(1.04)=6*1.04*0.0392207=6*0.0407895=0.244737. α log α=0.04*log(0.04)=0.04*(-3.218876)=-0.128755, -α log α=+0.128755. 5(2.04)log(2.04)=5*2.04*0.711246=5*1.45094=7.2547. Sum=0.2447+0.1288-7.2547=-6.8812. α=0.05: 6(1.05)log(1.05)=6*1.05*0.0487901=6*0.0512296=0.307378. α log α=0.05*log(0.05)=0.05*(-2.995732)=-0.1497866, -α log α=+0.149787. 5(2.05)log(2.05)=5*2.05*0.714723=5*1.46518=7.3259. Sum=0.3074+0.1498-7.3259=-6.8687. α=0.1 gave -6.9311, which is lower. So the maximum seems around α≈0.05? Actually -6.8687 is higher (less negative) than -6.8812? -6.8687 > -6.8812 (since -6.86 > -6.88). So f_5 increases up to some α then decreases. Let's test α=0.08: 6(1.08)log(1.08)=6*1.08*0.076961=6*0.083118=0.49871. α log α=0.08*log(0.08)=0.08*(-2.525729)=-0.202058, -α log α=+0.202058. 5(2.08)log(2.08)=5*2.08*0.733969=5*1.52666=7.6333. Sum=0.4987+0.2021-7.6333=-6.9325. That's about -6.9325, lower. So maximum around α≈0.05? Let's compute more precisely. We can solve f_5'(α)=0. f_5'(α) = 6 log(1+α) - log α - 5 log(2+α). Set g(α)=6 log(1+α) - log α - 5 log(2+α). We can solve numerically. At α=0.05: 6 log(1.05)=6*0.04879=0.29274; log α=log(0.05)=-2.99573; 5 log(2.05)=5*0.71784=3.5892. So g=0.29274 - (-2.99573) - 3.5892 = 0.29274 + 2.99573 - 3.5892 = -0.30073. Negative. At α=0.04: 6 log(1.04)=6*0.03922=0.23532; log α=-3.21888; 5 log(2.04)=5*0.71295=3.56475. g=0.23532 +3.21888 -3.56475 = -0.11055. At α=0.03: 6 log(1.03)=0.17735; log α=-3.50656; 5 log(2.03)=5*0.70804=3.5402. g=0.17735+3.50656-3.5402=0.14371. So g changes sign between 0.03 and 0.04. At α=0.035: log(1.035)=0.034401? Actually log(1.035)≈0.034401*? Let's compute: ln(1.035) ≈ 0.034401. Times 6 => 0.206406. log α = ln(0.035)≈ -3.352407. 5 log(2.035): ln(2.035)≈0.710529? Actually ln(2)=0.693147, ln(2.035)≈0.7105. 5*0.7105=3.5525. Then g=0.206406 +3.352407 -3.5525 = 0.006313. Slightly positive. So root near α≈0.0349 maybe. So the maximum of f_5 occurs at α0 ≈ 0.035. Then f_5(α0) ≈ value at that α. Compute f_5 at α=0.035: 6(1.035)log(1.035)=6*1.035*0.034401=6*0.035601=0.213606. α log α = 0.035*ln(0.035)=0.035*(-3.352407)= -0.117334, so -α log α = 0.117334. 5(2.035)log(2.035)=5*2.035*0.710529=5*1.445 =7.225? Let's compute: 2.035*0.710529=1.445? 2.035*0.7105=1.445. Times 5 = 7.225. So f_5 ≈ 0.2136+0.1173-7.225 = -6.8941. So maximum f_5 ≈ -6.894. Compare to f_5(0) = -6.9315. So the maximum is only slightly higher, still about -6.89. That is still negative and roughly constant independent of n. So log T ≈ n f_5(α) + constant. Since f_5(α) is negative (~ -6.89), T decays exponentially like exp( -6.89 n ). That's promising! Because then I_n = ∑_{k} T_{n,k} will be dominated by terms near the maximum, i.e., k ≈ α0 n. The sum over k will be approximated by an integral, and the exponential factor will be exp( n f_5(α0) ). So I_n decays exponentially like exp( c n ), with c ≈ -6.89.

Now we need to compare with the denominator growth when clearing denominators. In Beukers' integral for ζ(5), we would multiply by d_n^5 to get integers. Since d_n ~ e^n, d_n^5 ~ e^{5 n}. So we need I_n to decay faster than e^{-5 n} to have d_n^5 I_n → 0. That is, we need exp( n f_5(α0) ) to be smaller than e^{-5 n}, i.e., f_5(α0) < -5. Is -6.89 < -5? Yes, -6.89 is less than -5, so exp( -6.89 n ) decays faster than e^{-5 n}. Indeed, e^{-6.89 n} / e^{-5 n} = e^{-1.89 n} → 0. So d_n^5 I_n would tend to 0 exponentially. That suggests the Beukers-type integral for ζ(5) might actually work! Wait we need to be careful: The constant f_5(α0) we computed is about -6.89. That is less than -5, so the exponential decay rate is about 6.89 n, which is faster than 5 n. So after multiplying by d_n^5 ~ e^{5 n}, the product d_n^5 I_n would behave like e^{(5 + f_5(α0)) n} = e^{(5 - 6.89) n} = e^{-1.89 n} → 0. That's good for an irrationality proof: we would have integer sequences (after clearing denominators) that tend to zero, and one can show they are non-zero, implying irrationality.

But is this analysis correct? We must verify f_5(α) correctly. Let's double-check f_5(α) expression: log T = 6 log (n+k)! + 4 log n! - log k! - 5 log (2n+k+1)! + constant terms (including +5 from linear combination and 1/2 log terms). The dominant term is n times something when k scales as α n. We derived f_5(α) = 6(1+α) log(1+α) - α log α - 5(2+α) log(2+α). However, we must ensure that the coefficient 4 log n! is correctly accounted. In the scaling, log n! contributes n log n - n. That's part of the n log n cancellation. The term 4 n log n contributes to the coefficient of n log n, which cancels with other terms as we saw, leaving no n log n term. The remaining n-dependent term is indeed f_5(α) as defined. Good.

Now compute f_5(α) numeric more precisely. Let's find α that maximizes f_5. Solve f_5'(α)=0: 6 log(1+α) - log α - 5 log(2+α) = 0. This is equivalent to (1+α)^6 = α (2+α)^5. Let's solve this equation numerically. We can attempt to find α. We saw at α=0.035, g(α) ≈ 0.0063 positive, at α=0.034 maybe? Let's compute α=0.034: ln(1.034)=0.033423? Actually ln(1.034) ≈ 0.033423. 6*ln(1.034)=0.20054. ln(0.034)= -3.38139. 5*ln(2.034): ln(2.034) ≈ 0.7100? Let's compute ln(2)=0.693147, for 2.034, maybe 0.7100? Actually we can compute more accurately: ln(2.034) = ln(2) + ln(1.017) ≈ 0.693147 + 0.01686 = 0.710007. Times 5 = 3.550035. Then g = 0.20054 - (-3.38139) - 3.55004 = 0.20054 + 3.38139 - 3.55004 = 0.03189. That's positive. So g>0 at α=0.034. At α=0.04 we had g≈ -0.11055 negative. So root between 0.034 and 0.04. Let's try α=0.038: ln(1.038)=0.0373? Actually ln(1.038) ≈ 0.0373 (since ln(1.04)=0.03922, so 1.038 is slightly less). Let's approximate: ln(1.038) = 0.0373. 6*ln=0.2238. ln(0.038)= -3.27017. ln(2.038)= ln(2)+ln(1.019)=0.693147+0.01882=0.711967. 5*ln=3.559835. g=0.2238 +3.27017 -3.55984 = -0.06587. Negative. So root near 0.036? α=0.036: ln(1.036)=0.03537? Actually ln(1.036) ≈ 0.03537. 6*ln=0.2122. ln(0.036)= -3.32424. ln(2.036)= ln(2)+ln(1.018)=0.693147+0.01784=0.710987. 5*ln=3.554935. g=0.2122 +3.32424 -3.55494 = -0.0185. Slightly negative. α=0.0355: ln(1.0355)=0.03489? Let's compute: ln(1.0355) = approx 0.03489. 6*ln=0.20934. ln(0.0355)= -3.33886. ln(2.0355)= ln(2)+ln(1.01775)=0.693147+0.01761=0.710757. 5*ln=3.553785. g=0.20934 +3.33886 -3.55379 = -0.00559. Slight negative. α=0.0353: ln(1.0353)=0.03471? 6*ln=0.20826. ln(0.0353)= -3.34575. ln(2.0353)=0.693147+0.01747=0.710617. 5*ln=3.553085. g=0.20826+3.34575-3.55309=0.00092? Actually 0.20826+3.34575=3.55401, minus 3.55309=0.00092. Slightly positive. So root around α≈0.0354. So α0 ≈ 0.0354.

Now compute f_5(α0). Let's compute at α=0.0354. Compute ln(1.0354)=0.03478? Let's get more precise: ln(1.0354) = ln(1+0.0354) ≈ 0.0354 - 0.0354^2/2 + 0.0354^3/3 - ... = 0.0354 - 0.00062658 + 0.00001478 - ... ≈ 0.034788. So approx 0.034788. Then 6 ln(1.0354) = 0.20873. But we need (1+α) ln(1+α) = (1.0354)*0.034788 = 0.036019. Times 6 gives 0.21611. Actually compute: (1+α) ln(1+α) = 1.0354 * 0.034788 ≈ 0.036019. Then 6*(1+α) ln(1+α) = 6 * 0.036019 = 0.21611.

Now α ln α = 0.0354 * ln(0.0354). ln(0.0354) = -3.341. Compute: ln(0.035) ≈ -3.352, ln(0.036) ≈ -3.324, interpolate: at 0.0354, ln≈ -3.341. Then α ln α = 0.0354 * (-3.341) = -0.1183. So -α log α = +0.1183.

Now (2+α) ln(2+α) = 2.0354 * ln(2.0354). ln(2.0354) = ln(2) + ln(1.0177) ≈ 0.693147 + 0.01756 = 0.710707. Multiply: 2.0354 * 0.710707 ≈ 1.446. Then 5*(2+α) ln(2+α) = 5 * 1.446 = 7.23.

Now f_5 = 6(1+α) ln(1+α) - α ln α - 5(2+α) ln(2+α) = 0.21611 - (-0.1183) - 7.23? Wait careful: f_5 = 6(1+α) ln(1+α) - α ln α - 5(2+α) ln(2+α). Since α ln α is negative, - α ln α = -(negative) = positive. So f_5 = 0.21611 - ( -0.1183? Actually α ln α = -0.1183, so - α ln α = +0.1183. But the term is - α ln α, which is - (α ln α) = -(-0.1183) = +0.1183. So f_5 = 0.21611 + 0.1183 - 7.23 = -6.8956. So f_5 ≈ -6.896.

Thus f_5(α0) ≈ -6.896. That's less than -5. So indeed exponential decay rate ~ exp(-6.896 n). That's faster than exp(-5 n). So d_n^5 I_n → 0. Good.

But we must also account for the constant term +5 in log T, which adds factor e^5 ≈ 148.4, constant. And the 1/2 log terms contribute a polynomial factor in n. So overall T_{n,k} ≈ C n^{-1/2} e^{5} e^{n f_5(α)}? Something like that. But the exponential factor dominates.

Thus I_n = ∑_{k} T_{n,k} will be approximated by an integral that yields something like C * n^{-1/2} e^{n f_5(α0)} times some constant (by Laplace method). So I_n decays like C * n^{-1/2} e^{n f_5(α0)}. Then d_n^5 I_n ~ e^{5 n} * C n^{-1/2} e^{n f_5(α0)} = C n^{-1/2} e^{n (5 + f_5(α0))}. Since 5 + f_5(α0) ≈ 5 - 6.896 = -1.896, this tends to 0 exponentially. So the linear form tends to zero.

Now we need to ensure that the linear form is non-zero. Typically, one shows that I_n > 0 (since integrand positive) and that after clearing denominators, the resulting integer combination is not zero (i.e., A_n ζ(5) + B_n ≠ 0). Since I_n = A_n ζ(5) + B_n, and I_n > 0, if we can show that A_n and B_n are integers after multiplication by d_n^5, then d_n^5 I_n is a positive integer? Not necessarily integer; but we can argue that d_n^5 I_n is a positive integer? Actually in Beukers' proofs for ζ(2) and ζ(3), after multiplying by d_n^2 or d_n^3, the resulting number is an integer. He proves that d_n^2 I_n ∈ ℤ for ζ(2), and d_n^3 J_n ∈ ℤ for ζ(3). Then since I_n > 0 and tends to 0, for sufficiently large n, d_n^2 I_n is a positive integer less than 1, which is impossible unless it is zero. But it can't be zero because I_n > 0. Contradiction? Wait that's the proof of irrationality? Let's recall: In Beukers' proof for ζ(2), he shows that there exist integers p_n, q_n such that |ζ(2) - p_n/q_n| < 1/q_n^2. That implies irrationality. The construction: He defines rational approximations a_n/b_n = something. Actually the integral method yields that d_n^2 I_n is an integer, and also that I_n = a_n ζ(2) - b_n, with a_n, b_n integers. Then from positivity and smallness, one deduces that a_n ζ(2) - b_n is a non-zero rational number with denominator dividing something? Hmm.

Let's recall the exact structure: For ζ(2), Beukers defines

I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy.

He then shows that I_n = A_n ζ(2) + B_n, where A_n, B_n are integers. Actually I think he shows that I_n = a_n ζ(2) - b_n, with a_n, b_n integers. Moreover, 0 < I_n < 4/(5^n). And a_n, b_n are integers such that a_n ζ(2) - b_n = I_n. Then since I_n → 0, we have a_n ζ(2) - b_n → 0. If ζ(2) were rational p/q, then a_n p/q - b_n would be a rational with denominator q, and its absolute value would be at least 1/q if non-zero. But it can be made arbitrarily small, forcing it to be zero for large n. Then one can derive a contradiction using recurrence or show that I_n > 0 always, so cannot be zero. Thus ζ(2) irrational.

Thus the crucial points: (i) I_n = A_n ζ(5) - B_n with A_n, B_n integers (after clearing denominators). (ii) I_n → 0. (iii) I_n > 0 (or non-zero). Then ζ(5) irrational.

Now for our integral I_n for ζ(5), we need to establish that A_n, B_n are integers. The integral is

I_n = ∫_{[0,1]^5} \frac{ \prod_{i=1}^5 x_i^n (1-x_i)^n }{ (1 - x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5)^{n+1} } dx_1 ... dx_5.

Expanding as series yields:

I_n = ∑_{k=0}^\infty \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \int_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx \right)^5.

But note that the sum starts at k=0, and the term for k=0 is \binom{n}{0} [∫_0^1 x^n (1-x)^n dx]^5 = [B(n+1, n+1)]^5 = [ (n! n!)/(2n+1)! ]^5. That's rational. The series representation is valid for |X|<1, and on [0,1]^5, X = ∏ x_i ≤ 1, equality only at boundary measure zero, so expansion converges.

Now we can express ∫_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx = \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!}. This is a rational number. So each term is rational. Then I_n is a rational linear combination of 1 and ζ(5)? Wait we need to connect to ζ(5). How does ζ(5) appear? In the Beukers integrals for ζ(2) and ζ(3), the expansion yields a series that can be expressed as A_n ζ(2) + B_n. For ζ(2), the series representation after expansion is:

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \int_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx \right)^2.

But that sum does not obviously give ζ(2). However, Beukers shows that I_n = A_n ζ(2) - B_n. How? He uses the identity:

∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{ (x(1-x) y(1-y) )^n }{ (1-xy)^{n+1} } dx dy.

Then he performs a change of variables, partial fractions, or uses properties of the Beta function to extract ζ(2). Actually there is known formula:

∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \prod_{j=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{k^2}{j^2}\right)^{-1} ??? Not exactly.

Let's recall the derivation: For ζ(2), Beukers writes:

I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy.

He then expands (1-xy)^{-n-1} as a binomial series and integrates termwise, obtaining:

I_n = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \int_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx \right)^2.

Now note that ∫_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx = \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!}. So

I_n = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^2.

He then observes that this sum can be expressed as:

I_n = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{((n)!)^4}{k^2 \binom{n+k}{k}^2} ??? Not sure.

Actually there is known identity: \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^2 = \frac{ (n!)^2 }{ (n+k+1)^2 \binom{n+k}{n}^2 }? Let's try to derive:

\binom{n+k}{k} = \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!}. So term = \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!} * \frac{((n+k)! n!)^2}{(2n+k+1)!^2} = \frac{((n+k)!)^3 n!}{k! (2n+k+1)!^2}.

But perhaps there is a simplification using Beta integrals: \int_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx = \frac{1}{(n+k+1) \binom{n+k}{n}}? Let's check: \binom{n+k}{n} = \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!}. So 1/[(n+k+1) \binom{n+k}{n}] = \frac{n! k!}{(n+k+1)!}. That's not equal to \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!}. So not that.

Wait maybe we can relate to ζ(2) via the following: The sum over k of such terms yields something like \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{ ((n)!)^2 }{ \binom{n+k}{k}^2 }. Indeed, there is known Apéry sequence for ζ(2): a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k}^2, and the approximations involve \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}^2}. Something like that.

Actually Apéry's original proof for ζ(2) used the series:

a_n ζ(2) - b_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k} \binom{n}{k}}? Not exactly.

Let's derive from Beukers' integral: I_n = ∫_0^1∫_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy.

He then uses the substitution x = \frac{u}{1+u}, y = \frac{v}{1+v} maybe? Actually there is a transformation to convert the integral into something like ∫_0^∞∫_0^∞ \frac{u^n v^n}{(1+u)^{2n+2} (1+v)^{2n+2}} \frac{1}{1 - uv/((1+u)(1+v))} something. Not simple.

Better to recall the known result: For ζ(2), Beukers shows that

I_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \prod_{j=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{k^2}{j^2}\right)^{-1}.

Actually I think there is an identity:

\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}^2}.

Yes, I've seen that. Let's test for n=0: LHS = ∫∫ 1/(1-xy) dx dy = ζ(2). RHS = ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/k^2 * 1/1^2 = ζ(2). For n=1, LHS should equal ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/k^2 * 1/ \binom{1+k}{k}^2 = ∑ 1/k^2 * 1/(k+1)^2. That's a known constant. Does that match the integral? Possibly. I recall a known identity: \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{x^n y^n (1-x)^n (1-y)^n}{(1-xy)^{n+1}} dx dy = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}^2}. This is indeed true and can be proved by expanding 1/(1-xy)^{n+1} as a binomial series and using Beta integrals, then simplifying with combinatorial identities. Let's verify quickly:

(1-xy)^{-n-1} = ∑_{m=0}∞ \binom{n+m}{m} (xy)^m.

Then I_n = ∑_{m=0}∞ \binom{n+m}{m} ∫_0^1 x^{n+m} (1-x)^n dx ∫_0^1 y^{n+m} (1-y)^n dy = ∑_{m=0}∞ \binom{n+m}{m} \left( \frac{(n+m)! n!}{(n+m+n+1)!} \right)^2 = ∑_{m=0}∞ \binom{n+m}{m} \left( \frac{(n+m)! n!}{(2n+m+1)!} \right)^2.

Now, note that \frac{(n+m)! n!}{(2n+m+1)!} = \frac{1}{(n+m+1) \binom{2n+m+1}{n}}? Not sure. But there is known identity: \binom{n+m}{m} \left( \frac{(n+m)! n!}{(2n+m+1)!} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{(n+m+1)^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+m}{m}^2}? Let's test with n=1,m=0: LHS = \binom{1}{0} (1!*1!/(3)!)^2 = 1 * (1/6)^2 = 1/36. RHS if formula = 1/(2)^2 * 1/\binom{1}{0}^2 = 1/4 * 1 = 1/4, not equal. So not that.

Maybe the identity is: I_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k} \binom{n}{k}}? Not sure.

Let's search memory: In Beukers' paper "A note on the irrationality of ζ(2) and ζ(3)", he indeed uses the integrals and after expansion obtains:

I_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k} \binom{n}{k}}? Actually for ζ(3) he gets something like \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k} \binom{n}{k}}? I'm not certain.

But we can derive the connection to ζ(5) similarly. For the 5-dimensional integral, after expansion we get:

I_n = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^5.

We need to express this as A_n ζ(5) + B_n with integer A_n, B_n after clearing denominators. Possibly we can use the identity:

\sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} \right)^m = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^m} \prod_{j=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{k}{j}\right)^{-m} ??? Not exactly.

Actually there is a known formula: For integer n ≥ 0,

\int_0^1 \frac{x^{n} (1-x)^n}{(1 - x z)^{n+1}} dx = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k+1} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}} z^k? Something like that. Let's try to derive a generating function.

Consider the Beta integral: ∫_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx = \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!}. We can rewrite this as:

\frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} = \frac{n!}{(n+k+1) \binom{2n+k+1}{n}}? Because \binom{2n+k+1}{n} = \frac{(2n+k+1)!}{n! (n+k+1)!}. So \frac{n!}{(n+k+1) \binom{2n+k+1}{n}} = \frac{n!}{(n+k+1)} * \frac{n! (n+k+1)!}{(2n+k+1)!} = \frac{n!^2 (n+k+1)!}{(n+k+1)(2n+k+1)!} = \frac{n!^2 (n+k)!}{(2n+k+1)!}. That's not the same as \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!}. So not that.

But maybe we can express it as:

\frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} = \frac{1}{(n+k+1) \binom{n+k}{k}}? Let's compute: \binom{n+k}{k} = \frac{(n+k)!}{n! k!}. So 1/[(n+k+1) \binom{n+k}{k}] = \frac{n! k!}{(n+k+1)!}. Not our expression.

Another attempt: Write \frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} = \frac{1}{\binom{2n+k+1}{n} (n+k+1)}? Because \binom{2n+k+1}{n} = \frac{(2n+k+1)!}{n! (n+k+1)!}. So \frac{1}{\binom{2n+k+1}{n} (n+k+1)} = \frac{n! (n+k+1)!}{(2n+k+1)! (n+k+1)} = \frac{n! (n+k)!}{(2n+k+1)!}. That's missing a factor of (n+k)!? Actually we have (n+k)! n! / (2n+k+1)!. The expression we got is n! (n+k)!/(2n+k+1)!. So it matches! Because n! (n+k)! = (n+k)! n!. Yes! So

\frac{(n+k)! n!}{(2n+k+1)!} = \frac{1}{\binom{2n+k+1}{n} (n+k+1)}? Wait we have n! (n+k)! = (n+k)! n!. So indeed \frac{n! (n+k)!}{(2n+k+1)!} = \frac{1}{\binom{2n+k+1}{n} (n+k+1)}. Because \binom{2n+k+1}{n} = \frac{(2n+k+1)!}{n! (n+k+1)!}. Then its reciprocal is \frac{n! (n+k+1)!}{(2n+k+1)!}. Multiply by 1/(n+k+1) gives \frac{n! (n+k)!}{(2n+k+1)!}. Yes, that matches exactly. So

∫_0^1 x^{n+k} (1-x)^n dx = \frac{1}{(n+k+1) \binom{2n+k+1}{n}}.

Great! That's a nicer expression. Then

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \binom{n+k}{k} \left( \frac{1}{(n+k+1) \binom{2n+k+1}{n}} \right)^5.

Now, note that \binom{n+k}{k} = \binom{n+k}{n}. So we can write:

I_n = ∑_{k=0}∞ \frac{\binom{n+k}{n}}{ (n+k+1)^5 \binom{2n+k+1}{n}^5 }.

Now we can shift index: let m = n+k+1, then when k=0, m=n+1; as k→∞, m→∞. Also \binom{n+k}{n} = \binom{m-1}{n}, and \binom{2n+k+1}{n} = \binom{n+m}{n}? Since 2n+k+1 = 2n + (m - n - 1) + 1? Wait k = m - n - 1. Then 2n+k+1 = 2n + (m - n - 1) + 1 = n + m. Indeed, 2n + k + 1 = 2n + (m - n - 1) + 1 = n + m. Good. So

I_n = ∑_{m=n+1}^\infty \frac{ \binom{m-1}{n} }{ m^5 \binom{n+m}{n}^5 }.

Now, \binom{m-1}{n} = \frac{(m-1)!}{n! (m-n-1)!}, and \binom{n+m}{n} = \frac{(n+m)!}{n! m!}. So

\frac{ \binom{m-1}{n} }{ \binom{n+m}{n}^5 } = \frac{ (m-1)! }{ n! (m-n-1)! } * \left( \frac{n! m!}{(n+m)!} \right)^5 = \frac{ (m-1)! (n!)^5 (m!)^5 }{ n! (m-n-1)! (n+m)!^5 } = \frac{ (n!)^4 (m-1)! (m!)^5 }{ (m-n-1)! (n+m)!^5 }.

But maybe we can find a simpler representation. However, the expression I_n = ∑_{m=n+1}∞ \frac{ \binom{m-1}{n} }{ m^5 \binom{n+m}{n}^5 } resembles the form used in Apéry's approximations for ζ(3). Indeed, for ζ(3), Apéry used

a_n ζ(3) - b_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \frac{ \binom{k}{n} \binom{n+k}{k} }{ \binom{n}{k}^? }? Not exactly.

But there is known formula: For ζ(2), one has

∑_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{ \binom{k}{n} }{ \binom{n+k}{k} } = something. Actually I recall that Apéry's sequences for ζ(2) satisfy:

a_n ζ(2) - b_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{ \binom{n+k}{k} \binom{n}{k} }.

Let's check: For n=0, RHS = ∑ 1/k^2 = ζ(2). LHS would be a_0 ζ(2) - b_0. If a_0=1, b_0=0, works. For n=1, RHS = ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/k^2 * 1/( \binom{1+k}{k} \binom{1}{k} ). But \binom{1}{k}=0 for k>1, so only k=1 contributes? That seems off.

Maybe the correct formula is:

∑_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}^2} = something like that. Indeed, for n=0, \binom{k}{0}=1, so sum = ζ(2). For n=1, \binom{1+k}{k} = k+1, so sum = ∑ 1/(k^2 (k+1)^2). That sum is known to be π^2/3 - 3? Not sure. But it's rational combination of ζ(2) and 1. So that could be expressed as A_n ζ(2) + B_n. Indeed, we can write ∑_{k=1}∞ \frac{1}{k^2 (k+1)^2} = 2 - π^2/3? Actually ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/(k^2(k+1)^2) = π^2/3 - 3? Let's compute: 1/(k^2(k+1)^2) = (1/k - 1/(k+1))^2. Sum_{k=1}∞ (1/k - 1/(k+1))^2 = ∑ (1/k^2 - 2/(k(k+1)) + 1/(k+1)^2). The sum of 1/k^2 and 1/(k+1)^2 telescopes? Not exactly. But it's known that ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/(k^2(k+1)^2) = π^2/3 - 3. I recall that ∑ 1/(k(k+1)) = 1, ∑ 1/(k^2(k+1)^2) = π^2/3 - 3 ≈ -0.71? That's negative, impossible since terms positive. So maybe it's 2 - π^2/3? Let's compute numeric: π^2/6≈1.6449, π^2/3≈3.2899. 2 - π^2/3 ≈ -1.2899, negative. So not that. Actually compute sum numerically: k=1: 1/(1*4)=0.25; k=2: 1/(4*9)=0.0277778; k=3: 1/(9*16)=0.00694444; k=4: 1/(16*25)=0.0025; k=5: 1/(25*36)=0.0011111; k=6: 1/(36*49)=0.0005669; sum ≈ 0.2889. So it's about 0.289. π^2/3 - 3 ≈ 0.2899, yes that matches! π^2/3 ≈ 3.2899, minus 3 = 0.2899. So indeed ∑ 1/(k^2(k+1)^2) = π^2/3 - 3. That is positive. So that works. So indeed ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/(k^2 \binom{k+1}{1}^2) = π^2/3 - 3. This can be expressed as A ζ(2) + B with A=1, B=-3? Actually π^2/3 - 3 = (1/3)π^2 - 3. Since ζ(2)=π^2/6, then π^2/3 = 2 ζ(2). So expression = 2 ζ(2) - 3. So A=2, B=-3. That's integer linear combination. Good.

Thus the identity for general n might be:

∑_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}^2} = A_n ζ(2) + B_n, with A_n, B_n integers. This is plausible because 1/ \binom{n+k}{k}^2 can be expressed as a polynomial in 1/k^2 plus lower order terms that telescope.

In fact, there is a known identity:

\frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}} = \frac{n! k!}{(n+k)!} = \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)...(k+n)} * n! * something? Actually \frac{k!}{(n+k)!} = \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)...(k+n)}. So 1/ \binom{n+k}{k} = n! * \frac{k!}{(n+k)!} = n! / ((k+1)(k+2)...(k+n)). So 1/ \binom{n+k}{k}^2 = (n!)^2 / ∏_{i=1}^n (k+i)^2.

Thus ∑_{k=1}∞ \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{\binom{n+k}{k}^2} = (n!)^2 ∑_{k=1}∞ \frac{1}{k^2 \prod_{i=1}^n (k+i)^2}.

This sum can be expressed as a rational linear combination of ζ(2) and 1, because the rational function in k can be decomposed into partial fractions, leading to sums of the form ∑ 1/(k+j)^2, which are ζ(2) minus some finite sums, and also terms like 1/k(k+j) etc which telescope. Indeed, one can write:

\frac{1}{k^2 \prod_{i=1}^n (k+i)^2} = \sum_{j=0}^n \frac{A_j}{(k+j)^2} + \sum_{j=0}^n \frac{B_j}{k+j} + maybe something that telescopes. But the sum over k of 1/(k+j) diverges, so coefficients B_j must be zero due to symmetry or because the decomposition ensures cancellation. Actually one can express it as a linear combination of 1/(k)^2, 1/(k+1)^2, ..., 1/(k+n)^2. Because the rational function is symmetric under replacing k with -k? Not exactly. But there is a known identity: For any polynomial P(k) with degree d, we can write 1/P(k) as a sum of simple fractions with denominators (k+r_i). For squares, it's more complicated, but still one can express 1/(k^2 (k+1)^2 ... (k+n)^2) as ∑_{j=0}^n \frac{C_j}{(k+j)^2} plus something like ∑ D_j/(k+j) that sum to zero when summed over all integers k due to telescoping if D_j are such that ∑ D_j = 0? Actually ∑_{k=1}∞ 1/(k+j) diverges, so any non-zero D_j would cause divergence. Therefore, in the partial fraction decomposition, the coefficients of 1/(k+j) must be zero because the original sum converges absolutely (since denominator is degree
